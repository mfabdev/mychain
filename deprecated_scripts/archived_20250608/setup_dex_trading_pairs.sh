# Setup DEX trading pairs via governance proposal or direct state update

echo "Setting up DEX trading pairs..."

# Since the DEX module doesn't have a direct CLI command to create trading pairs,
# and they should be loaded from genesis, we need to:
# 1. Either restart the chain with proper genesis
# 2. Or implement a governance proposal to add them
# 3. Or add a custom transaction type

# For now, let's document what needs to be done:
echo "The DEX module needs trading pairs to be initialized."
echo ""
echo "Current issue: Trading pairs are not loaded from genesis"
echo ""
echo "Trading pairs that should exist:"
echo "  1. MC/TUSD (umc/utusd)"
echo "  2. MC/LC (umc/ulc)"
echo "  3. USDC/TUSD (usdc/utusd)"
echo ""
echo "Solutions:"
echo "  1. Stop chain, export state, add DEX config, restart"
echo "  2. Implement MsgCreateTradingPair transaction type"
echo "  3. Use governance proposal to update DEX params"
echo ""
echo "For immediate testing, you can use the blockchain without DEX until proper initialization."
