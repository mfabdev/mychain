# Session Summary: Inflation Adjustment Speed Increase

## Date: January 13, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on tripling the speed of inflation adjustment in the blockchain by reducing the blocks_per_year parameter to exactly 1/3 of the standard value.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Wallet Disconnection Issue
- **Problem**: Users were getting logged out when pasting order information in the DEX page
- **Solution**: Removed `window.location.reload()` in DEXPage.tsx and replaced with data refresh
- **File**: `web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx`

### 2. Attempted Fix for Staking Display Bug
- **Problem**: Mint recorder showing 0% bonded ratio when it's actually 93.4%
- **Issue**: Circular dependency in module initialization preventing staking keeper access
- **Attempted Fix**: Changed keeper passing from value to pointer in module methods
- **Files**: 
  - `x/mychain/module/module.go`
  - `x/mychain/module/abci.go`
  - `x/mychain/module/depinject.go`

### 3. Tripled Inflation Adjustment Speed
- **Change**: Reduced blocks_per_year from 6,311,520 to 2,103,840 (exactly 1/3)
- **Effect**: Inflation now adjusts 3x faster toward the target
- **Files Modified**:
  - `scripts/unified-launch.sh` - Updated genesis configuration
  - `x/mychain/keeper/mint_recorder.go` - Updated blocks per year constant

### 4. Key Parameters After Changes
```
blocks_per_year: "2103840"
goal_bonded: "0.500000000000000000"
inflation_max: "1.000000000000000000"
inflation_min: "0.070000000000000000"
inflation_rate_change: "1.000000000000000000"
mint_denom: ulc
```

## Technical Details

### Inflation Calculation
- The mint module uses blocks_per_year to calculate how much to adjust inflation each block
- With 1/3 the blocks per year, each block represents 3x more time
- This makes the inflation adjustment happen 3x faster in real time

### Why This Works
- This change only affects inflation calculations
- Does not impact other time-related features (epochs, governance, etc.)
- The mint module remains functionally correct, just adjusts faster

## Verification
After restarting the blockchain with new parameters:
- Confirmed blocks_per_year is 2,103,840
- Confirmed inflation_rate_change is 1.0 (maximum)
- Current inflation: ~100% (will decrease faster now)

## Next Steps
- Monitor inflation rate decrease over time
- Should reach target bonded ratio equilibrium 3x faster
- No further changes needed unless adjustment speed needs modification
