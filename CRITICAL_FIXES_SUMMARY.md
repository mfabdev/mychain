# Critical Fixes Summary - MainCoin Implementation

## Executive Summary
Fixed two critical bugs that were causing incorrect token distribution and economic model violations in the MainCoin bonding curve implementation.

## Bug 1: Segment Boundary Violation
**Impact**: High - Economic model completely broken

### Before
- System would spend entire purchase amount regardless of segment boundaries
- $1.00 purchase would buy ~9,990 MC instead of ~10.98 MC needed
- Violated the 1:10 reserve ratio requirement

### After  
- System correctly caps purchases at segment boundaries
- Only buys exact tokens needed to reach 1:10 ratio
- Properly refunds unused funds
- Maintains economic model integrity

## Bug 2: Dev Allocation Per Segment
**Impact**: Medium - Unfair dev token distribution

### Before
- Dev allocation calculated only once at end of transaction
- Dev received only 10 MC when 25 segments were processed
- Violated the "0.01% per segment" rule

### After
- Dev allocation calculated at the end of EACH segment
- Includes all tokens in segment (purchased + distributed dev)
- Dev correctly receives ~0.026775 MC for 25 segments
- Maintains per-segment fairness

## Key Code Locations
1. **Main Logic**: `/x/maincoin/keeper/analytical_purchase_with_deferred_dev.go`
2. **Message Handler**: `/x/maincoin/keeper/msg_server_buy_maincoin.go`
3. **Module Init**: `/x/maincoin/module/module.go`

## Test Transaction Results
```
Input: $1.00 purchase request
Spent: $0.028252 (only what was needed)
Segments: 25 completed
User tokens: 279.01 MC
Dev tokens: 0.026775 MC
Refunded: $0.971748
```

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check transaction
mychaind query tx <TXHASH> --node tcp://localhost:26657

# Check dev balance
mychaind query bank balances cosmos1596fcwtk69cy2k8vuax3xcugcrj8zcj80cw4yt

# Check user balance  
mychaind query bank balances cosmos19rl4cm2hmr8afy4kldpxz3fka4jguq0auqdal4
```

## Status
✅ Both fixes implemented and tested successfully
✅ Economic model integrity restored
✅ Dev allocation working correctly per-segment
✅ Ready for production use
