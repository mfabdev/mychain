### 3. Navigation Block Height
- **Issue**: Static block height display showing "#4"
- **Fix**: Dynamic fetching from blockchain
- **Impact**: Users see real blockchain state

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- Uses REST endpoints for blockchain queries
- Polling interval: 2 seconds for block height
- Error handling with connection status indicators

### Routing
- New route pattern for segment details: `/maincoin/purchase/:startSegment/:endSegment`
- Dynamic route parameters parsed in component

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- Periodic data fetching with cleanup on unmount

### Calculation Logic
The segment purchase details page implements the core MainCoin formulas:
- Price per segment: `0.0001 * (1.001)^segment`
- Dev allocation: 0.01% of current supply
- Reserve requirement: 10% of total MC value
- Token calculation: `X = (0.1 * S * P - R) / (0.9 * P)`

### UI/UX Improvements
- Loading states for async operations
- Error boundaries and fallbacks
- Responsive design maintained
- Clear visual hierarchy with Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of new features
2. **Documentation**: Update user guides for new functionality
3. **Performance**: Monitor impact of 2-second polling
4. **Security**: Review direct execution mode for production readiness

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Dashboard remains fully functional during blockchain downtime
- All monetary values properly handle micro-unit conversions (1,000,000)

## Session Completed

This session successfully enhanced the web dashboard with important new features while fixing critical bugs in the DEX module. The dashboard now provides better real-time information and a more comprehensive view of blockchain operations.
