# Session Record: Segment Boundary and Dev Allocation Fixes

## Date: June 5, 2025

## Overview
This session involved fixing two critical bugs in the MainCoin bonding curve implementation:
1. **Segment Boundary Bug**: System was purchasing far more tokens than needed to complete segments
2. **Dev Allocation Bug**: Dev allocation was only calculated once per transaction instead of per-segment

## Initial Problem Report

### Issue 1: Segment Boundary Violation
- **Symptom**: Purchasing $1.00 bought ~9,990 MC instead of just 10.98 MC needed for segment completion
- **Expected**: System should only buy enough tokens to reach the 1:10 reserve ratio for each segment
- **Actual**: System was using all available funds, violating segment boundaries

### Issue 2: Dev Allocation Distribution
- **Symptom**: Dev only received 10 MC when processing 25 segments
- **Expected**: Dev should receive 0.01% allocation calculated at the end of each segment
- **Actual**: Dev allocation was only calculated once at the end of all segments

## Files Modified

### 1. `/x/maincoin/keeper/analytical_purchase_with_deferred_dev.go`
Primary file containing the purchase logic and calculations.

#### Key Changes:
- Fixed unit conversion errors (mixed TESTUSD/MC with utestusd/uMC)
- Added purchase capping logic to limit tokens to amount needed for 1:10 ratio
- Fixed cost calculation to use exact amount needed, not all remaining funds
- Modified dev allocation to calculate per-segment
- Fixed nil pointer initialization issue

### 2. `/x/maincoin/keeper/msg_server_buy_maincoin.go`
Message server handling buy requests (minor updates for logging).

### 3. `/x/maincoin/module/module.go`
Module initialization logic (contains BeginBlock workaround).

## Technical Details of Fixes

### Segment Boundary Fix

#### Problem Code:
```go
// Was using all affordable tokens regardless of segment boundary
affordableTokensDec := remainingFunds.Quo(currentPriceInMicro)
tokensToBuy = affordableTokensDec.Mul(sdkmath.LegacyNewDecFromInt(microUnit)).TruncateInt()
```

#### Fixed Code:
```go
// Calculate tokens needed to reach exact 1:10 ratio
divisor := pricePerUMC.Mul(sdkmath.LegacyNewDecWithPrec(9, 1)) // 0.9 * P
tokensNeededDec = reserveDeficit.Quo(divisor)

// Cap purchases at tokens needed
if affordableTokensUMC.LT(tokensNeededDec) {
    tokensToBuy = affordableTokensUMC.TruncateInt()
} else {
    tokensToBuy = tokensNeededDec.TruncateInt()
}

// Calculate exact cost based on tokens to buy
costDec = sdkmath.LegacyNewDecFromInt(tokensToBuy).Mul(pricePerUMC)
```

### Dev Allocation Fix

#### Problem:
Dev allocation was calculated once on `currentSegmentTokens` which didn't include dev distributed at segment start.

#### Solution:
```go
// Calculate dev allocation for THIS completed segment
// CRITICAL: Include both purchased tokens AND dev distributed at start of segment
totalSegmentTokens := currentSegmentTokens
if segmentsProcessed == 0 && pendingDevAllocation.GT(sdkmath.ZeroInt()) {
    totalSegmentTokens = totalSegmentTokens.Add(pendingDevAllocation)
} else if segmentsProcessed > 0 && devDistributedInSegment.GT(sdkmath.ZeroInt()) {
    totalSegmentTokens = totalSegmentTokens.Add(devDistributedInSegment)
}

// Calculate 0.01% of ALL tokens in this segment
devDec := sdkmath.LegacyNewDecFromInt(totalSegmentTokens).Mul(devAllocationRate)
segmentDevAllocation := devDec.TruncateInt()
accumulatedPendingDev = accumulatedPendingDev.Add(segmentDevAllocation)
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- $1.00 purchase → 9,990 MC bought (incorrect)
- Dev received: 10 MC only (from initial segment)

### After Fix
- $1.00 purchase → Only $0.028252 spent
- Tokens bought: ~279.04 MC
- User received: ~279.01 MC
- Dev received: ~0.026775 MC
- Segments completed: 25
- Remaining funds: $0.971748 (correctly refunded)

### Verification
```bash
# Dev account balance check
mychaind query bank balances cosmos1596fcwtk69cy2k8vuax3xcugcrj8zcj80cw4yt
# Result: 10,026,775 uMainCoin (10 MC initial + 0.026775 MC from transaction)
```

## Documentation Created

1. **SEGMENT_BOUNDARY_FIX.md** - Detailed explanation of the segment boundary issue
2. **AUTOMATIC_SEGMENT_PROGRESSION_DEMO.md** - Live demonstration of the fix
3. **SEGMENT_PROGRESSION_FIX_FINAL.md** - Final implementation details
4. **DEV_ALLOCATION_PER_SEGMENT_FIX.md** - Initial dev allocation fix documentation
5. **DEV_ALLOCATION_PER_SEGMENT_FIX_COMPLETE.md** - Final dev allocation fix summary
6. **COMPLETE_MAINCOIN_SETUP.md** - Comprehensive setup guide

## Key Learnings

1. **Unit Consistency**: Always maintain consistent units throughout calculations (uMC vs MC)
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Segment boundaries must be strictly enforced to maintain economic model
3. **Dev Allocation Timing**: Dev must be calculated at segment end but distributed at next segment start
4. **Transaction Atomicity**: Multiple segments can be processed in one transaction while maintaining correctness

## Commands Used

### Building
```bash
go build -o build/mychaind ./cmd/mychaind
```

### Fresh Start
```bash
./scripts/stop_node.sh
./scripts/fresh_start.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
# Import admin key
./scripts/import_admin_key.sh

# Make purchase
mychaind tx maincoin buy-maincoin 1000000utestusd --from admin --chain-id mychain --yes --gas 300000 --fees 1alc --keyring-backend test

# Check results
mychaind query tx <TXHASH> --node tcp://localhost:26657
mychaind query bank balances <ADDRESS> --node tcp://localhost:26657
```

## Final State

The MainCoin bonding curve now correctly:
- ✅ Enforces segment boundaries (1:10 reserve ratio)
- ✅ Caps purchases at exact amount needed per segment
- ✅ Calculates dev allocation for each segment
- ✅ Distributes dev allocation at the start of subsequent segments
- ✅ Processes multiple segments efficiently in single transaction
- ✅ Refunds unused funds to the buyer

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive tests with various purchase amounts
2. Verify behavior across segment boundaries
3. Test edge cases (very small purchases, exact segment amounts)
4. Consider adding more detailed event emissions for tracking
5. Update any frontend components to handle multi-segment purchases correctly
