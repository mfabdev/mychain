# Clean Blockchain Update Complete - January 10, 2025

## Summary
Updated the blockchain launch process to ensure clarity about fresh starts and removed all hardcoded/mock data from the UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. DEX Page Updates
- Removed hardcoded mock trades (0.000100, 0.000099, 0.000101)
- "Recent Trades" section now shows "No trades executed yet" until real trades occur
- This ensures users see only actual blockchain data

### 2. Unified Launch Script Enhancements
- Added explicit "FRESH BLOCKCHAIN STARTED" message
- Lists what users should expect:
  - All previous data cleared
  - Starting from block 1
  - Transaction history shows only new transactions
  - DEX has no orders or trade history

### 3. Created Verification Tools
- `scripts/verify-fresh-blockchain.sh` - Verifies blockchain is truly fresh
- Checks: block height, transaction types, DEX state, genesis time
- `TRANSACTION_HISTORY_EXPLANATION.md` - Explains why MINT transactions appear

## Understanding Transaction History

The MINT transactions you see are CORRECT and EXPECTED:
- They are from the CURRENT blockchain run (not old data)
- The mint module creates inflation rewards on every block
- With 0% bonded, inflation is at maximum (100% APR)
- Each block generates ~15,844 ulc in rewards

## Verification Results
```
✓ Block height indicates fresh blockchain (458)
✓ No user transactions found - blockchain is fresh
✓ No DEX orders - fresh state
✓ Genesis was created within the last hour
```

## What Users See After Fresh Launch

1. **Transaction History Page**:
   - Only MINT inflation transactions
   - All from current blockchain run
   - No sends, delegates, or DEX orders from previous runs

2. **DEX Page**:
   - Empty order books
   - "No trades executed yet" in Recent Trades
   - No liquidity rewards earned yet

3. **Balances**:
   - Fresh genesis amounts only
   - No accumulated rewards from previous runs

## Clean Start Guarantee

The `unified-launch.sh` script ensures complete cleanup by removing:
- `/home/dk/.mychain/data/` (all blockchain data)
- `/home/dk/.mychain/data/application.db` (transaction history)
- All temporary files and keys

Every launch is truly a fresh start from genesis!
