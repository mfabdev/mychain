# Staking Page Update

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The Staking page has been updated to show SDK minting information instead of the old hourly distribution system.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created New SDK Minting Display Component
- Shows current inflation rate (~100% APR)
- Displays effective staking APR (inflation ÷ bonded ratio)
- Shows bonded ratio vs goal (90% vs 50%)
- Explains how SDK minting adjusts inflation dynamically

### 2. Updated Staking Page
- Replaced old "Dynamic APR based on staking ratio" with "SDK Minting with Dynamic Inflation"
- Removed hourly distribution UI elements
- Updated staking benefits to reflect SDK minting rewards

### 3. Updated Staking Statistics
- Shows minted tokens since genesis
- Displays current inflation parameters
- Shows effective APR for stakers
- Removed hourly distribution history

## What You Should See Now

### SDK Minting Section:
- **Current Inflation**: ~99.99% APR
- **Effective Staking APR**: ~111.1% (inflation ÷ 0.9 bonded ratio)
- **Bonded Ratio**: 90% (Target: 50%)
- **Total Staked**: 90,000 ALC
- **Rate Change**: 93% per year

### SDK Minting Statistics:
- **Currently Staked**: 90,000 ALC (Earning 111.1% APR)
- **Available to Stake**: 10,007 ALC
- **Current Total Supply**: 100,007 ALC
- **Minted Since Genesis**: +7 ALC

## How It Works Now

1. **Dynamic Inflation**: Adjusts between 7-100% based on bonded ratio
2. **Above Goal**: Since 90% > 50% goal, inflation decreases
3. **Block Rewards**: New LC minted each block, distributed to stakers
4. **No Hourly Batches**: Continuous reward distribution
