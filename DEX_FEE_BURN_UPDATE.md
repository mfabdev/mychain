# DEX Fee Burn Mechanism Update

## Overview
Updated the DEX fee system to burn 100% of collected fees instead of distributing them, creating deflationary pressure on the LC token supply.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Fee Distribution
**Before**: Fees were to be distributed:
- 40% to validators/delegators
- 30% to community pool  
- 20% to LP rewards
- 10% to development

**After**: 
- **100% of all fees are BURNED**
- Permanent removal from circulation
- Automatic burning at end of each block

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Added BurnCollectedFees Function
```go
func (k Keeper) BurnCollectedFees(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Get all collected fees
    balance := k.bankKeeper.GetBalance(ctx, moduleAddr, "ulc")
    
    // Burn entire balance
    err := k.bankKeeper.BurnCoins(ctx, types.ModuleName, coins)
    
    // Emit burn event
    sdkCtx.EventManager().EmitEvent(
        sdk.NewEvent("fees_burned", 
            sdk.NewAttribute("amount", balance.String()),
        ),
    )
}
```

#### EndBlock Integration
- Fees are burned automatically at the end of each block
- Non-blocking: errors are logged but don't halt the chain

### 3. Economic Impact

#### Deflationary Mechanism
- Every trade reduces LC supply
- Every cancellation reduces LC supply
- Every sell order reduces LC supply
- Creates upward price pressure on LC

#### Supply Dynamics
- Initial LC supply: 100,000 LC
- Burns create permanent supply reduction
- Higher trading volume = more deflation
- Market downturns increase burn rate (dynamic fees)

### 4. Example Calculations

#### Normal Market (price at 100%)
- 1M TUSD daily volume
- ~0.03% average fee (maker + taker)
- Daily burn: ~300 TUSD worth of LC
- Annual burn rate: ~0.1% of LC supply

#### Market Downturn (price at 90%)
- Dynamic fee increase: +0.08%
- Total average fee: ~0.11%
- Daily burn: ~1,100 TUSD worth of LC
- Annual burn rate: ~0.4% of LC supply

### 5. Benefits of Burning

1. **Simplicity**: No complex distribution logic
2. **Fairness**: All LC holders benefit equally
3. **Transparency**: Easy to track and verify
4. **Deflationary**: Creates long-term value accrual
5. **No Governance**: No disputes over distribution ratios

### 6. Events and Monitoring

All fee burns emit events:
```
fees_collected: Individual fee collection
fees_burned: Batch burn at end of block
```

Monitor burn rate with:
```bash
mychaind query txs --events 'fees_burned.module=dex'
```

### 7. Configuration

Burning is automatic when fees are enabled:
```json
{
  "fees_enabled": true,
  // All collected fees will be burned
}
```

No additional configuration needed - if fees are collected, they will be burned.
