# Implementation Update Summary

## Critical Correction Made

The MainCoin calculation logic has been corrected throughout the codebase. The fundamental error was applying a 10× multiplier when calculating token purchases.

### WRONG Logic (Previously)
```
Purchase Amount = Deficit ÷ 0.1  // WRONG!
Tokens = Purchase Amount ÷ Price
```
This gave incorrect values like 109.89 MC for Segment 1.

### CORRECT Logic (Now Implemented)
```
Tokens Needed = Deficit ÷ Price
Cost = Tokens × Price
```
This gives correct values like 10.99 MC for Segment 1.

## Files Created/Updated

### 1. Authoritative Documentation
- **AUTHORITATIVE_MAINCOIN_CALCULATIONS.md** - Master reference with correct calculations
- **CORRECT_CALCULATION_LOGIC.md** - Explains why the calculation is correct
- **SEGMENTS_0_TO_3_FINAL_CORRECT.md** - Detailed walkthrough with correct numbers

### 2. Implementation Files
- **analytical_purchase_with_deferred_dev_corrected.go** - Corrected calculation logic
  - Removed the incorrect `purchaseNeeded := reserveDeficit.Quo(reserveRatio)` 
  - Implemented correct `tokensNeededDec := reserveDeficit.Quo(currentPriceCalc)`
  - Fixed reserve addition to use full cost (not 10%)

### 3. Test Files
- **deferred_dev_test_corrected.go** - Tests with correct expected values
  - Segment 1: 10.99 MC (not 109.89)
  - Segment 2: 12.09 MC (not 211.80)
  - Segment 3: 11.25 MC (not 311.17)

## Correct Values Summary

| Segment | Tokens Bought | Cost | Dev Distributed | Final Supply |
|---------|--------------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0 | 100,000 MC | $1.00 | 0 | 100,000 MC |
| 1 | 10.99 MC | $0.00110011 | 10 MC | 100,020.99 MC |
| 2 | 12.09 MC | $0.00121139 | 10.002 MC | 100,043.082 MC |
| 3 | 11.25 MC | $0.00112838 | 10.004 MC | 100,064.336 MC |

## Key Insights

1. **Reserve Mechanics**: The entire purchase cost goes to reserves, not just 10%
2. **Token Value**: Tokens needed equals the deficit divided by price
3. **Dev Impact**: Genesis's 10 MC dev allocation causes Segment 1 to need 10.99 MC instead of ~1 MC
4. **Growth Pattern**: After Genesis impact, segments grow more predictably

## Next Steps

The old implementation files should be replaced with the corrected versions:
- Replace `analytical_purchase_with_deferred_dev.go` with the corrected version
- Replace `deferred_dev_test.go` with the corrected test
- Update any UI or documentation that shows the old incorrect values

## Critical Rule

**ALWAYS REMEMBER: Tokens Needed = Deficit ÷ Price**

There is no 10× multiplier. The bonding curve maintains the 1:10 ratio naturally.
