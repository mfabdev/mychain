# GitHub Push Summary - January 12, 2025

## Session Overview
This session implemented partial eligibility for DEX volume caps, fixed tier display issues, integrated MainCoin price into DEX, and resolved UI stability problems.

## Major Changes

### 1. Partial Eligibility Implementation
**Problem**: Orders that exceeded volume caps were completely ineligible for rewards
**Solution**: Implemented proportional rewards based on how much of an order fits within the cap

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `volume_cap_fraction` field to `OrderRewardInfo` proto message
- Modified `lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go` to calculate and apply partial caps
- Updated reward calculations to multiply by volume cap fraction
- Orders now receive 0-100% of rewards based on volume cap utilization

#### Frontend Changes:
- Added visual indicators for eligible/partial/ineligible orders
- Created `RewardEligibilityChart` component with progress bars
- Display percentage of eligibility for partial orders
- Color-coded status pills (green/yellow/red)

### 2. Fixed Tier Display Issues
**Problem**: Orders were showing incorrect tier numbers (Tier 2/3 instead of Tier 1)
**Solution**: 
- Changed from per-order tier calculation to system-wide tier determination
- All orders now use the same tier based on current market conditions
- Backend stores the correct tier_id during reward distribution

### 3. MainCoin Price Integration
**Problem**: DEX was showing hardcoded $0.0001 instead of actual MC price
**Solution**:
- Integrated DEX module with MainCoin module
- Added `MainCoinKeeper` interface to DEX expected keepers
- Updated `GetCurrentMarketPrice` to fetch real MC price
- Fixed frontend to properly display the price (removed unnecessary division by 1M)

### 4. UI Stability Improvements
**Problem**: Development server kept crashing with "too many open files" error
**Solution**:
- Switched from development server to production build served with `serve`
- More stable and doesn't have file watching issues
- UI now stays running consistently

## Technical Details

### Volume Cap Calculation
```go
// For partially exceeding orders
if newEligibleValue.GT(volumeCap) {
    remainingCap := volumeCap.Sub(currentVolume)
    if remainingCap.IsPositive() {
        cappedFraction = remainingCap.Quo(orderValue)
        orderValue = orderValue.Mul(cappedFraction)
    }
}
```

### Proto Changes
```proto
message OrderRewardInfo {
  // ... existing fields ...
  string volume_cap_fraction = 9 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "cosmossdk.io/math.LegacyDec",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `proto/mychain/dex/v1/types.proto` - Added volume_cap_fraction field
2. `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go` - Implemented partial volume capping
3. `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards.go` - Apply volume cap fraction in reward calculations
4. `x/dex/types/types.pb.go` - Generated proto code
5. `web-dashboard/src/components/LiquidityPositions.tsx` - Added partial eligibility UI
6. `web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx` - Fixed MC price display

## New Files Created
1. `SESSION_SUMMARY_partial_eligibility.md` - Detailed session notes
2. `web-dashboard/public/test-partial-eligibility.html` - Test page for the feature

## Testing
Created test orders demonstrating:
- Fully eligible orders (100% within cap)
- Partially eligible orders (e.g., 60% within cap)
- Ineligible orders (0% within cap)

## Impact
- Users can now see exactly how much of their order is eligible for rewards
- More fair reward distribution - partial rewards instead of all-or-nothing
- Better user experience with clear visual feedback
- Accurate market price display in DEX

## Next Steps
- Monitor reward distribution with partial eligibility
- Consider adding order adjustment suggestions to fit within caps
- Add more detailed analytics for volume cap utilization
