# DEX Fix Summary

## Problem
The DEX module parameters are showing as zeros despite correct genesis configuration:
- `base_reward_rate`: Should be "222", showing "0"
- `lc_denom`: Should be "ulc", showing ""
- Other parameters also showing as zeros

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Genesis Loading Issue**: Parameters in genesis.json are correct but not being loaded into the keeper
2. **Module Initialization**: The DEX module account doesn't appear to be created
3. **Parameter Storage**: Collections storage might not be properly initialized

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Code Changes Made
- Fixed `DefaultLCDenom` from "liquiditycoin" to "ulc" in `x/dex/types/params.go`
- Fixed `DefaultBaseRewardRate` from 70000 to 222 in `x/dex/types/params.go`
- Updated `msg_server_init_dex_state.go` to:
  - Check parameters BEFORE checking trading pairs
  - Allow parameter updates even if initialized
  - Force correct values when initializing

### 2. Build Process
- Regenerated protobuf files with `make proto-gen`
- Rebuilt and installed binary with `make install`
- Restarted blockchain with fresh data

## Current State
Despite the fixes:
- Parameters still show as zeros
- Trading pairs exist but can't be queried properly
- Tier information is partially working
- CLI order placement has parsing issues

## Underlying Issues
1. **Collections Storage**: The params might not be properly stored/retrieved from collections
2. **Module Registration**: DEX module might not be fully registered in app.go
3. **Proto Mapping**: Potential mismatch between proto definitions and Go types

## Workarounds Available
1. **Web Dashboard**: Use http://localhost:3000/dex for DEX operations
2. **REST API**: Direct API calls can bypass CLI issues
3. **Terminal Server**: Running on port 3003 for transaction execution

## Next Steps Required
To fully fix the DEX module:

1. **Check Module Registration**:
   - Verify DEX module is properly registered in app/app.go
   - Ensure keeper is initialized with correct store keys

2. **Debug Collections Storage**:
   - Add logging to InitGenesis to verify params are being set
   - Check if params.Get() is looking at the right storage location

3. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Implement a governance proposal to update params
   - Add a force-update command that bypasses initialization checks
   - Use a migration to fix existing state

## Conclusion
The DEX module has a fundamental initialization issue that requires debugging at the keeper/storage level. The fixes applied address the configuration values but don't resolve the underlying storage/retrieval problem. The module is partially functional (tiers work, price references work) but parameters are not accessible.
