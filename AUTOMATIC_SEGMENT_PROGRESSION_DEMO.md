# Automatic Segment Progression Demonstration

## Date: June 5, 2025

## Live Demonstration Results

### Initial State (Genesis - Segment 0)
The blockchain started with:
- 100,000 MC pre-minted in bank module
- $1.00 in MainCoin module reserves
- Price: $0.0001 per MC
- Perfect 1:10 reserve ratio achieved

### Automatic Progression to Segment 1
Upon detecting the perfect 1:10 ratio at block height 1, the system automatically:

1. **Progressed to Segment 1**
2. **Calculated dev allocation**: 10 MC (0.01% of 100,000 MC)
3. **Minted and distributed dev tokens** to cosmos1596fcwtk69cy2k8vuax3xcugcrj8zcj80cw4yt
4. **Increased price by 0.1%**: $0.0001 → $0.0001001

### Current State (Segment 1)
```json
{
  "current_epoch": "1",
  "current_price": "0.000100100000000000",
  "total_supply": "100010000000",
  "reserve_balance": "1000000",
  "tokens_needed": "10990010",
  "reserve_ratio": "0.099890110889010999",
  "dev_allocation_total": "10000000"
}
```

### Key Metrics
- **Segment**: 1
- **Price**: $0.0001001 per MC (correctly increased by 0.1%)
- **Total Supply**: 100,010 MC (10 MC dev allocation added)
- **Reserve Balance**: $1.00 (unchanged)
- **Reserve Ratio**: 9.989% (slightly below 10% due to dev allocation)
- **Tokens Needed**: 10.99 MC to restore perfect 1:10 ratio

### Dev Allocation Verification
```bash
$ mychaind query bank balances cosmos1596fcwtk69cy2k8vuax3xcugcrj8zcj80cw4yt
balances:
- amount: "10000000"
  denom: maincoin
```

The dev address correctly received 10 MC (10,000,000 uMainCoin).

### Log Evidence
From the blockchain logs:
```
MAINCOIN: Module not initialized, initializing in BeginBlock at height 1
MAINCOIN DEBUG: InitGenesis called
MAINCOIN DEBUG: CurrentEpoch set to 0
MAINCOIN DEBUG: CurrentPrice set to 0.000100000000000000
MAINCOIN DEBUG: Bank module has existing supply: 100000000000maincoin
MAINCOIN DEBUG: TotalSupply set to 100000000000
MAINCOIN DEBUG: ReserveBalance set to 1000000
MAINCOIN: Progressed to segment 1 with dev allocation of 10000000 MC
MAINCOIN: Module initialized successfully
```

### Calculation Verification
The system correctly calculates that 10.99 MC are needed to restore the 1:10 ratio:
```
CalculateTokensNeeded: 1100.100000000000000000 utestusd / 100.100000000000000000 utestusd/MC = 10.990009990009990010 MC
```

## Conclusion
The automatic segment progression feature is working perfectly:
- ✅ Detects when 1:10 ratio is achieved
- ✅ Automatically progresses to the next segment
- ✅ Calculates correct dev allocation (0.01%)
- ✅ Mints and distributes dev tokens
- ✅ Increases price by exactly 0.1%
- ✅ Updates all state variables correctly

This ensures the tokenomics model functions autonomously without manual intervention.
