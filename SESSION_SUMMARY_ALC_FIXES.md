# Session Summary: Test Account Removal and ALC Display Fixes

## Date: January 5, 2025

### Overview
This session focused on cleaning up the blockchain initialization by removing test accounts and fixing ALC token display issues in the web dashboard.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Test Account Removal
**Problem**: Alice and Bob test accounts were being created with 1M ALC each, which was not desired.

**Solution**: Modified `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/scripts/init_default.sh` to:
- Remove Alice and Bob account creation
- Remove their genesis balance allocations
- Keep only the validator account with proper token distribution

#### 2. Token Distribution Fix
**Problem**: Validator had 100k ALC liquid + 90k stake tokens (total 190k tokens instead of 100k).

**Solution**: 
- Changed staking denomination from "stake" to "ALC" 
- Updated mint module to use ALC for inflation rewards
- Ensured validator has exactly 100k ALC total (10k liquid + 90k staked)

**Final Token Distribution**:
- MainCoin: 100,000 MC (bonding curve module)
- TestUSD: 100,000 TESTUSD (validator)
- ALC: 100,000 ALC (10k liquid + 90k staked to validator)

#### 3. Web Dashboard ALC Display Fix
**Problem**: Dashboard showed "0 ALC" in Token Supply section despite blockchain having ~100k ALC.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard was checking for lowercase denominations ('ulc' and 'alc') instead of uppercase 'ALC'.

**Files Fixed**:
1. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/web-dashboard/src/components/BlockInfo.tsx`
   - Line 68: Changed from `coin.denom === 'alc'` to `coin.denom === 'ALC'`

2. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/web-dashboard/src/pages/OverviewPage.tsx`
   - Line 27: Changed from `token.denom === 'ulc'` to `token.denom === 'ALC'`

**Result**: Dashboard now correctly displays ALC token supply.

### Technical Details

#### Genesis Configuration
The blockchain now initializes with:
```json
{
  "staking": {
    "params": {
      "bond_denom": "ALC"
    }
  },
  "mint": {
    "params": {
      "mint_denom": "ALC"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Initialization Script
The `init_default.sh` script now:
1. Creates only the validator account
2. Adds genesis balance: 100000000000utestusd,100000000000ALC
3. Stakes 90000000000ALC from validator
4. Configures ALC as the staking and mint denomination

### Verification
- Blockchain successfully initialized with correct token distribution
- No test accounts (Alice/Bob) present
- Validator has exactly 100k ALC (10k liquid + 90k staked)
- Web dashboard displays correct ALC supply after rebuild

### Next Steps
All changes are ready to be committed and pushed to GitHub.
