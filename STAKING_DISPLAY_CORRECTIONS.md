# Staking Display Corrections

## Status: ✅ FIXED

Corrected the SDK Minting Statistics display to show accurate decimal values.

## What Was Fixed

### SDK Minting Statistics Now Shows:
- **Current Total Supply**: 100,010.95 ALC (was showing 100,010)
- **Minted Since Genesis**: +10.95 ALC (was showing +10)
- **Available to Stake**: 10,010.95 ALC (was showing 10,010)

### The Issue:
- SDK minting has created 10.95 ALC since genesis
- The display was rounding to whole numbers, hiding the decimal part
- This made it look like exactly 10 ALC was minted (which would be confusing with MainCoin's 10 MC dev allocation)

### How SDK Minting Works:
1. **Continuous Process**: New LC is minted every block
2. **Current Rate**: ~100% annual inflation
3. **Distribution**: Goes only to staked tokens (90,000 ALC)
4. **Effective APR**: 111.1% for stakers (100% ÷ 0.9 bonded ratio)

## Current Accurate Values:
- Initial Supply: 100,000.00 ALC
- Current Supply: 100,010.95 ALC
- Minted by SDK: +10.95 ALC
- Staked: 90,000.00 ALC
- Available: 10,010.95 ALC

## Note on Inflation:
With 90% staked (above 50% goal), inflation is gradually decreasing from 100% toward 7% minimum. The rate of decrease is 93% per year, so it will take time to reach the minimum.
