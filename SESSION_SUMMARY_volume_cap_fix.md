# Session Summary: Volume Cap Fix for DEX Rewards

## Date: January 24, 2025

### Problem Identified
All DEX orders were receiving full rewards regardless of volume caps. The system was supposed to limit rewards based on tier-specific caps (e.g., 2% for bid, 1% for ask in Tier 1) but wasn't enforcing these limits.

### Root Cause
The volume cap checking logic was missing from the reward distribution function. Orders were being processed without verifying if they exceeded the volume limits.

### Solution Implemented
Updated `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go` to:

1. **Calculate volume caps** based on MC supply value:
   ```go
   bidVolumeCap := tierLiq.tier.BidVolumeCap.Mul(mcSupplyValueInQuote)
   askVolumeCap := tierLiq.tier.AskVolumeCap.Mul(mcSupplyValueInQuote)
   ```

2. **Process orders with cap checking**:
   - Track cumulative eligible volume
   - Check if adding each order would exceed the cap
   - Partially include orders that partially fit under the cap
   - Completely exclude orders that don't fit at all

3. **Separate bid and ask processing**:
   - Buy orders checked against bid volume cap
   - Sell orders checked against ask volume cap

### Key Code Changes
```go
// Check if adding this order would exceed the cap
newEligibleValue := eligibleBuyValue.Add(orderValue)
if newEligibleValue.GT(bidVolumeCap) {
    // Check if we can partially include this order
    remainingCap := bidVolumeCap.Sub(eligibleBuyValue)
    if remainingCap.IsPositive() {
        // Calculate what fraction of the order fits under the cap
        cappedFraction := remainingCap.Quo(orderValue)
        orderValue = orderValue.Mul(cappedFraction)
        
        k.Logger(ctx).Info("Order partially capped",
            "orderId", order.Id,
            "originalValue", orderValue.Quo(cappedFraction),
            "cappedValue", orderValue,
            "cappedFraction", cappedFraction,
            "bidVolumeCap", bidVolumeCap,
        )
    } else {
        // No room left under the cap, skip this order entirely
        k.Logger(ctx).Info("Order excluded by volume cap",
            "orderId", order.Id,
            "orderValue", orderValue,
            "eligibleBuyValue", eligibleBuyValue,
            "bidVolumeCap", bidVolumeCap,
        )
        continue
    }
}
```

### Volume Cap Tiers
| Tier | Price Deviation | Bid Cap | Ask Cap |
|------|----------------|---------|---------|
| 1    | ≥ -3%          | 2%      | 1%      |
| 2    | ≥ -8%          | 5%      | 3%      |
| 3    | ≥ -12%         | 8%      | 4%      |
| 4    | < -12%         | 12%     | 5%      |

### Testing Status
- Code has been implemented and blockchain restarted
- Waiting for block 100 (first reward distribution) to verify caps are working
- Created monitoring script at `scripts/monitor-volume-caps.sh`

### Next Steps
1. Wait for block 100 for first reward distribution
2. Monitor logs for volume cap messages
3. Verify that orders exceeding caps are properly limited or excluded
4. Test with various order sizes to ensure partial capping works correctly

### Impact
This fix ensures that DEX inflation is properly controlled by volume caps, preventing unlimited rewards and maintaining sustainable tokenomics as designed.
