# Session Summary: DEX Testing Infrastructure

## Date: January 11, 2025

### Session Overview
Created comprehensive testing infrastructure for the DEX implementation, including automated test scripts, monitoring tools, and documentation.

### Work Completed

1. **Created DEX Testing Plan** (`DEX_TESTING_PLAN.md`)
   - Outlined 7 core test scenarios
   - Defined expected results
   - Provided troubleshooting guide

2. **Developed Test Scripts**
   - `test_dex_liquidity_rewards.sh` - Tests tier-based reward system
   - `test_dex_fees.sh` - Validates fee calculation and collection
   - `test_dex_complete.sh` - Comprehensive 7-test suite
   - `dex_load_test.sh` - Performance testing with multiple traders
   - `run_all_dex_tests.sh` - Master script to run all tests
   - `monitor_dex.sh` - Real-time monitoring dashboard

3. **Created Documentation**
   - `DEX_MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step manual testing
   - `RUN_DEX_TESTS.md` - Quick start guide
   - `DEX_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Comprehensive implementation summary

### Key Features Tested
- Order matching (buy/sell at same price)
- Partial order fills
- Tier-based liquidity rewards (4 tiers)
- Dynamic fee system (price and liquidity based)
- Order cancellation with fees
- Price impact and liquidity depth
- Multi-trader stress testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit-level: Individual feature testing
- Integration: Cross-feature interactions
- Performance: Load testing with concurrent orders
- Monitoring: Real-time activity tracking

### Technical Details
- All scripts use Cosmos SDK CLI (`mychaind`)
- JSON parsing with `jq` for data extraction
- Colored output for easy result interpretation
- Automated account creation and funding
- Parallel order placement for stress testing

### Results
- Complete testing infrastructure ready for use
- All scripts made executable
- Documentation provides clear usage instructions
- Monitoring tools enable real-time observation

### Next Steps (If Needed)
1. Run the test suite: `./scripts/run_all_dex_tests.sh`
2. Monitor activity: `./scripts/monitor_dex.sh`
3. Review logs for any issues
4. Adjust parameters based on test results

### Files Created/Modified
- 6 new test scripts in `scripts/`
- 4 new documentation files
- All scripts made executable with proper permissions

The DEX testing infrastructure is complete and ready for immediate use.
