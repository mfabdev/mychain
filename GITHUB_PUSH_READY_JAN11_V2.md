# GitHub Push Instructions - January 11, 2025 (Updated)

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Dynamic DEX Reward System (7-100% APR)
Replaced the fixed tier-based reward system with an elegant dynamic adjustment mechanism:

**Key Features:**
- Initial rate: 100% APR (attracts initial liquidity)
- Rate adjusts Â±0.25% every 6 hours based on market conditions
- Minimum rate: 7% APR (sustainable long-term)
- Maximum rate: 100% APR (strong incentives when needed)
- Liquidity targets scale with price: 2-12% of MainCoin supply
- Historical volume requirements: 48-120 hours based on price level

**Technical Implementation:**
- No artificial tier boundaries - smooth, continuous adjustments
- Market-responsive incentives based on actual liquidity needs
- Fixed base_reward_rate from 222 to 70000 (proper 7% calculation)
- Added DynamicRewardState tracking and query endpoint

### 2. Web Dashboard Auto-Start Enhancement
- Dashboard now starts automatically during blockchain initialization
- No manual intervention required - accessible immediately at http://localhost:3000
- Proper process cleanup and dependency management

## Push Instructions

```bash
# View the changes
git log --oneline -3

# Check current status
git status

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Alternative Remote Push
If you have the startlqc remote configured:
```bash
git push startlqc main
```

## Testing After Push

### 1. Launch Fresh Blockchain
```bash
./scripts/unified-launch.sh --reset
```

### 2. Verify Web Dashboard
- Should auto-start and be accessible at http://localhost:3000
- No manual startup required

### 3. Test Dynamic Rewards
```bash
# Place some liquidity orders
mychaind tx dex create-order 1 true 100000utusd 1000000umc --from user1 --yes

# Wait 100 blocks for distribution
# Then check dynamic reward state
mychaind query dex dynamic-reward-state

# Check user rewards
mychaind query dex user-rewards <address>
```

### 4. Monitor Rate Adjustments
- Initial rate: 100% APR
- Adjusts every 4320 blocks (6 hours)
- Watch it decrease as liquidity targets are met
- Or increase if liquidity is insufficient

## Summary
This update delivers a sophisticated market-responsive reward system that eliminates rigid tiers in favor of smooth, continuous adjustments. Combined with the web dashboard auto-start, the blockchain now offers a seamless user experience with intelligent liquidity incentives.
