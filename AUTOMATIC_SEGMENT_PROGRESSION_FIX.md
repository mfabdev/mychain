# Automatic Segment Progression Fix Record

## Date: June 5, 2025

## Issue Fixed
When the blockchain started with a perfect 1:10 reserve ratio at Segment 0, it was not automatically progressing to Segment 1. The system should automatically progress when the ratio is achieved, applying dev allocation and price increase.

## User Requirement
"WHEN BALANCE IS REACHED 1:10 SEGMENT MUST CHANGE AND BOTH DEV ALLOCATION CALCULATED AND ADDED PLUS PRICE OF MAINCOIN MUST BE RAISED BY 0.1%"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Price Increment Parameter
**File:** `x/maincoin/types/params.go`
```go
DefaultPriceIncrement = "0.001" // 0.1% (changed from 0.01 which was 1%)
```

### 2. Implemented Automatic Segment Progression in BeginBlock
**File:** `x/maincoin/module/module.go`

Added logic to the BeginBlock initialization that:
1. Checks if the current reserve ratio equals the required 1:10 ratio
2. If perfect ratio is achieved, automatically progresses to the next segment
3. Calculates and distributes dev allocation (0.01% of current supply)
4. Increases price by 0.1% (multiplier of 1.001)
5. Updates all state variables accordingly

Key code snippet:
```go
// If we have perfect ratio, progress to segment 1
if actualReserve.Equal(requiredReserve) {
    // Calculate dev allocation (0.01% of supply)
    devAllocation := genState.TotalSupply.Mul(math.NewInt(1)).Quo(math.NewInt(10000)) // 0.01%
    
    // Update to segment 1
    newEpoch := uint64(1)
    newPrice := genState.CurrentPrice.Mul(math.LegacyNewDecWithPrec(1001, 3)) // 1.001x (0.1% increase)
    newSupply := genState.TotalSupply.Add(devAllocation)
    
    // Apply the progression and mint/distribute dev tokens
    // ... (state updates and token distribution)
}
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix (Segment 0)
```json
{
  "current_epoch": "0",
  "current_price": "0.000100000000000000",
  "total_supply": "100000000000",
  "reserve_balance": "1000000",
  "tokens_needed": "0",
  "reserve_ratio": "0.100000000000000000",
  "dev_allocation_total": "0"
}
```

### After Fix (Automatic Progression to Segment 1)
```json
{
  "current_epoch": "1",
  "current_price": "0.000100100000000000",
  "total_supply": "100010000000",
  "reserve_balance": "1000000",
  "tokens_needed": "10990010",
  "reserve_ratio": "0.099890110889010999",
  "dev_allocation_total": "10000000"
}
```

## Verification Points
1. ✅ Automatic progression from Segment 0 to Segment 1 when 1:10 ratio achieved
2. ✅ Dev allocation: 10 MC (0.01% of 100,000 MC) correctly calculated
3. ✅ Dev tokens minted and sent to dev address: cosmos1596fcwtk69cy2k8vuax3xcugcrj8zcj80cw4yt
4. ✅ Price increased by exactly 0.1%: $0.0001 → $0.0001001
5. ✅ Total supply increased: 100,000 MC → 100,010 MC
6. ✅ Tokens needed to restore ratio: 10.99 MC (correctly calculated)

## Technical Details

### Genesis Configuration
- Started with 100,000 MC pre-minted at $0.0001 each
- $1.00 in reserves (achieving perfect 1:10 ratio)
- This triggered automatic progression on first block

### Module Initialization
- MainCoin module initializes in BeginBlock at height 1 (workaround for InitGenesis not being called)
- Checks for perfect ratio immediately after initialization
- Applies segment progression within the same block

### State Changes
- CurrentEpoch: 0 → 1
- CurrentPrice: 0.0001 → 0.0001001 (0.1% increase)
- TotalSupply: 100,000 MC → 100,010 MC
- DevAllocationTotal: 0 → 10 MC
- Reserve ratio: 10% → 9.989% (due to dev allocation dilution)

## Files Modified
1. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/x/maincoin/types/params.go` - Fixed price increment to 0.1%
2. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/x/maincoin/module/module.go` - Added automatic segment progression logic

## Summary
The automatic segment progression feature is now working correctly. When the blockchain achieves a perfect 1:10 reserve ratio, it automatically:
1. Progresses to the next segment
2. Calculates and distributes dev allocation (0.01% of supply)
3. Increases the price by exactly 0.1%
4. Updates all relevant state variables

This ensures the tokenomics model functions as designed without manual intervention.
