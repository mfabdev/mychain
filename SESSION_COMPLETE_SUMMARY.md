# Session Complete Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented segment history recording with REST API endpoints and optimized gas usage.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Web Dashboard Display Issues
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed "0 ALC" for token supply
- **Solution**: Fixed denomination checks from lowercase 'alc'/'ulc' to uppercase 'ALC'
- **Files**: BlockInfo.tsx, OverviewPage.tsx

### 2. Corrected Dev Allocation Display
- **Problem**: All segments showing "10" for dev allocation
- **Solution**: Implemented correct logic showing:
  - Segment 0: "-" (no dev)
  - Segment 1: "10" (0.01% of 100k genesis)
  - Other segments: "~0.001" (0.01% of ~11 MC)
- **File**: MainCoinPage.tsx

### 3. Implemented Segment History REST Endpoints
- **Problem**: REST endpoints returning "Not Implemented"
- **Solution**: 
  - Endpoints were already properly defined in proto files
  - Query handlers were implemented but segment recording was disabled
  - Created optimized recording system
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment-history`
  - `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment/{segment_number}`
  - `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment-statistics`

### 4. Optimized Segment History Recording
- **Problem**: Gas usage >500,000 causing transaction failures
- **Solution**: Created optimized recording system
  - Event-based tracking instead of full state storage
  - Aggregate data only (no individual records)
  - Removed user history tracking
  - Direct key-value storage
- **Result**: Gas usage reduced to ~190,000 (62% reduction)
- **File**: segment_history_optimized.go

### 5. Web Dashboard Integration
- **Updated**: useSegmentHistory hook to use correct REST endpoints
- **Added**: Fallback to calculated data when blockchain data unavailable
- **Result**: Seamless display of both historical and real-time segment data

## Technical Details

### Gas Optimization Techniques
1. **Events over State**: Emit events for detailed tracking (much cheaper)
2. **Aggregate Storage**: Only store summary when segments complete
3. **No User Indexing**: Removed per-user history (can reconstruct from events)
4. **Efficient Storage**: Direct KV store instead of complex collections

### Testing Results
- Transaction: `D6032CA61D1CEA90C62B39A01027A6D602923B41CFD9D46351E262B3EA7C44F2`
- Segments crossed: 26-33 (8 segments)
- Gas used: 190,441 / 300,000
- Status: Success

## Files Modified
1. **Web Dashboard** (4 files):
   - `web-dashboard/src/hooks/useSegmentHistory.ts`
   - `web-dashboard/src/pages/MainCoinPage.tsx`
   - `web-dashboard/src/pages/OverviewPage.tsx`
   - `web-dashboard/src/utils/config.ts`

2. **Backend** (4 files):
   - `x/maincoin/keeper/msg_server_buy_maincoin.go`
   - `x/maincoin/keeper/segment_history.go`
   - `x/maincoin/keeper/segment_history_optimized.go` (new)
   - `x/maincoin/keeper/state.go`

3. **Documentation** (9 files):
   - Various markdown files explaining implementation details

## Current Blockchain State
- Current Segment: 34
- Total Supply: 100,386,110,311 (smallest unit)
- Current Price: $0.000103456703065563 per MC
- Reserves: $1,038,247 (utestusd)

## Next Steps for User
1. Push to GitHub using instructions in GITHUB_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS_FINAL.md
2. Verify deployment and test REST endpoints
3. Monitor gas usage for future optimizations

## Key Insights
- Dev allocation is 0.01% of NEW minted tokens, not total supply
- Segment progression requires exact 1:10 reserve ratio
- Event-based tracking is significantly more gas-efficient than state storage
- REST endpoints were properly implemented but needed backend optimization
