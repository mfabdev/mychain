# Session Summary: Dynamic Reward Rates Implementation

## Date: January 12, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing DEX module initialization issues and implementing dynamic reward rates for liquidity providers.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed DEX Module Initialization
- **Problem**: DEX parameters were showing as 0 despite module registration
- **Root Cause**: Protobuf field mismatch between genesis.json and proto definitions
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed proto field names (bid_volume_cap/ask_volume_cap instead of volume_cap_tusd/volume_cap_mc)
  - Implemented BeginBlock initialization as a workaround for depinject modules
  - Updated unified-launch.sh to use correct decimal values for fee percentages

### 2. Implemented Dynamic Reward Rates
- **Base System**: 7% APR (base_reward_rate: 222)
- **Dynamic Range**: 7-100% APR based on liquidity depth
- **Target Liquidity**: $1,000,000
- **Adjustment Speed**: 0.25% every 100 blocks
- **Distribution**: Proportional to liquidity value, equal for all providers

### 3. Removed Directional Incentives
- Initially implemented 90/10 (MC/TUSD) and 80/20 (MC/LC) buy/sell splits
- Removed per user request to maintain fair, equal treatment for all liquidity providers
- Cleaned up related files and implementations

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **x/dex/module/module.go**
   - Added HasABCIGenesis interface implementation
   - Implemented BeginBlock with DEX initialization
   - Calls DistributeLiquidityRewardsWithDynamicRate

2. **x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go**
   - Implements dynamic rate calculation
   - Distributes rewards proportionally to all providers
   - No directional bias

3. **x/dex/keeper/dynamic_rewards.go**
   - Calculates dynamic rate based on liquidity vs target
   - Adjusts rate up when below target, down when above
   - Stores state for persistence

4. **proto/mychain/dex/v1/types.proto**
   - Fixed LiquidityTier message fields
   - Restored percentage-based volume caps

### Key Parameters
```go
// Dynamic Reward Configuration
MinRate: 222 (7% annual)
MaxRate: 3175 (100% annual)
LiquidityThreshold: $1,000,000
AdjustmentSpeed: 0.25% per distribution
BlocksPerHour: 100 (for testing, normally 3600)
```

## Testing Results
- DEX module initializes correctly with all 22 parameters
- Dynamic rate starts at 100% APR when liquidity is low
- Rewards distribute every 100 blocks as expected
- Equal distribution to all liquidity providers based on value

## Ready for GitHub Push
All changes have been committed with detailed commit message. The system now:
- Uses a single dynamic rate for all providers
- Adjusts rate based on total liquidity
- Treats all liquidity providers equally
- Maintains tier-based volume caps for security

## Next Steps
1. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. Test on testnet with real users
3. Monitor dynamic rate adjustments
4. Fine-tune parameters if needed
