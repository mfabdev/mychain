# Complete MainCoin Setup Solution

## Summary

We have successfully configured the blockchain with the correct genesis state as requested:

### Genesis Configuration:
- **User1 Account** (cosmos17cuk8zgaw6vw4n7368f4lcaafkk880r3klgs9e):
  - 100,000 ALC (stake tokens for gas fees) ✓
  - 100,000 MainCoin ✓  
  - 100,000 TestUSD ✓

- **MainCoin Module Account**:
  - 1 TestUSD in reserves ✓

- **Bank Module State**:
  - User1 has all the correct balances ✓
  - Total supply correctly includes 100,000 MainCoin ✓

### Current Issue:
The MainCoin module's InitGenesis is not being called by the Cosmos SDK framework. This means:
- The bank module has the correct token distribution
- But the MainCoin module's internal state is not initialized
- This causes the module to start from epoch 0 with 0 supply

### Impact:
1. User1 correctly has 100,000 MainCoin in their wallet
2. The MainCoin module thinks there are 0 MainCoin
3. First purchase will mint additional MainCoin (duplicate minting)

### Design Intent:
- **Segment 0**: Start with 100,000 MC at $0.0001, with $1 in reserves (10% ratio)
- **Segment 1**: After dev allocation of 10 MC, have 100,010 MC at $0.000101
- Need to sell 10.99 MC to maintain the 1:10 ratio before moving to Segment 2

### Token Economics:
- **ALC/stake**: Used for transaction gas fees ✓
- **TestUSD**: Used only for purchasing MainCoin ✓
- **MainCoin**: Follows bonding curve with 1:10 reserve ratio

## Recommendations:

1. **Short-term workaround**: Make a small initial purchase to initialize the module state, then adjust balances

2. **Long-term fix**: Debug why InitGenesis is not being called and fix the module initialization

3. **Alternative**: Create a custom genesis command that properly initializes both bank and module state

The blockchain is running with the correct token distribution, but the MainCoin module needs manual initialization.
