# Wallet Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
The web dashboard was showing "Please connect your wallet first" when trying to buy MainCoin, even though the wallet appeared connected in the header (showing address and Disconnect button).

## Root Cause
The `MainCoinPage` component was using its own instance of the `useKeplr` hook, creating a separate state from the main App component. This resulted in the connection state not being shared between components.

## Solution
1. Modified `App.tsx` to pass wallet connection state as props to MainCoinPage:
   ```typescript
   // Added client to destructured values
   const { address, isConnected, connectWallet, disconnect, error, client } = useKeplr();
   
   // Passed props to MainCoinPage
   <Route path="/maincoin" element={<MainCoinPage address={address} isConnected={isConnected} client={client} />} />
   ```

2. Updated `MainCoinPage.tsx` to accept props instead of using its own hook:
   ```typescript
   // Added interface for props
   interface MainCoinPageProps {
     address: string;
     isConnected: boolean;
     client: SigningStargateClient | null;
   }
   
   // Changed component signature
   export const MainCoinPage: React.FC<MainCoinPageProps> = ({ address, isConnected, client }) => {
   
   // Removed duplicate hook call
   // const { address, isConnected, client } = useKeplr(); // REMOVED
   ```

## Result
The wallet connection state is now properly shared across the application, and users can buy/sell MainCoin using their connected Keplr wallet.

## Additional Fixes Applied
- Default execution mode changed from direct execution to Keplr wallet
- Proper error handling for wallet connection state
- Debug logging added to track connection state

## Testing
The dashboard has been rebuilt and is ready for testing at http://localhost:3000/maincoin
