# Fresh Blockchain Status

## Summary

The blockchain has been successfully restarted with a completely fresh state as requested.

## What Was Done

1. **Cleared all blockchain data**
   - Removed ~/.mychain directory completely
   - All previous transaction history cleared
   - All previous state removed

2. **Initialized fresh blockchain**
   - Chain ID: mychain
   - Created new validator account: cosmos1rlq8nych427yp8dppnta6v6yarp3r0myjrvwew
   - Allocated initial funds:
     - 1,000,000,000,000 ALC (gas token)
     - 100,000,000,000 stake (staking token)
     - 100,000,000,000,000 utestusd (test USD)

3. **Fixed configuration**
   - Set minimum gas prices to 0.025ALC
   - Enabled API server on port 1317
   - Fixed bond denom to "stake" in genesis

4. **Started fresh node**
   - Node is running and producing blocks
   - Current height: ~10+ blocks
   - API server is active
   - Transaction recording system is operational

## Current Status

- **Blockchain**: Running fresh from genesis
- **API**: Active at http://localhost:1317
- **Transaction History**: Empty (fresh start)
- **Web Dashboard**: Ready to use at http://localhost:3000
- **All Systems**: Operational

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Start making transactions on the fresh blockchain
2. Test all features with clean state
3. Push code changes to GitHub as planned
4. Begin development/testing on the fresh chain

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check blockchain status
mychaind status

# Check validator account balance
mychaind q bank balances cosmos1rlq8nych427yp8dppnta6v6yarp3r0myjrvwew

# Check transaction history (should be empty)
curl http://localhost:1317/mychain/mychain/v1/transaction-history/cosmos1rlq8nych427yp8dppnta6v6yarp3r0myjrvwew

# View node logs
tail -f ~/.mychain/node.log
```
