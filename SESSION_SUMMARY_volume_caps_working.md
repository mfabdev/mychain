# Session Summary: Volume Caps Implementation Complete

## Date: January 12, 2025

## Summary

Successfully implemented and verified volume cap enforcement for DEX liquidity rewards.

## Volume Caps Working Correctly

The logs confirm proper volume cap enforcement:

### Buy Orders (2% cap = $0.295):
- **Order 1**: $0.10 → 100% eligible ✅
- **Order 2**: $1.00 → 19.5% eligible (capped to $0.195) ✅
- **Order 3**: $1.96 → 0% eligible (excluded) ✅
- **Order 4**: $4.75 → 0% eligible (excluded) ✅

### Sell Orders (1% cap = $0.148):
- **Order 5**: $0.525 → 28.1% eligible (capped to $0.148) ✅
- **Order 6**: $1.10 → 0% eligible (excluded) ✅
- **Order 7**: $2.40 → 0% eligible (excluded) ✅

## Implementation Details

1. **Fixed unit conversion** in `GetMCSupplyValueInQuote` to properly convert between micro and whole units
2. **Added volume accumulation** that processes orders by competitiveness (best prices first)
3. **Implemented partial capping** where orders can receive a fraction of their potential rewards
4. **Added comprehensive logging** to track cap calculations and enforcement
5. **Updated order reward info** to store volume cap fractions even for excluded orders

## Confirmed Working

From the logs:
```
Buy order partially capped orderId=2 cappedFraction=0.195337831606722811
Sell order partially capped orderId=5 cappedFraction=0.281274125339736011
Buy order excluded by volume cap orderId=3
Buy order excluded by volume cap orderId=4
Sell order excluded by volume cap orderId=6,7
```

## API Verification

Order rewards query shows correct cap fractions:
- Order 1: `volume_cap_fraction: "1.000000000000000000"` (fully eligible)
- Orders 3,4,6,7: `volume_cap_fraction: "0.000000000000000000"` (excluded)
- Orders 2,5: Partial fractions stored internally

## Files Modified

1. `/x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards.go` - Fixed `GetMCSupplyValueInQuote` unit conversion
2. `/x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go` - Implemented volume cap logic with accumulation
3. `/web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx` - Fixed user address for liquidity positions

## Result

Volume caps are now properly enforced, preventing excessive rewards when liquidity exceeds tier limits. Only the most competitive orders (closest to market price) receive rewards up to the cap limits.
