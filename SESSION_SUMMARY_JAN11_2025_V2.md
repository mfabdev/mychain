# Session Summary - January 11, 2025

## Part 1: Dynamic DEX Rewards (7-100% APR)
**Status**: ✅ Completed and Pushed to GitHub

Implemented a dynamic reward system that adjusts between 7-100% APR based on liquidity needs:
- Replaced fixed tier system with continuous adjustment
- Rate changes ±0.25% every 6 hours
- Successfully pushed to GitHub (commit `63a92f29`)

## Part 2: Balanced Buy/Sell Rewards
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

Enhanced the reward system to incentivize balanced liquidity on both sides:

### What Was Added:
1. **Separate tracking** for buy orders (TUSD→MC) and sell orders (MC→TUSD)
2. **Dynamic multipliers** (1x-2x) for the underrepresented side
3. **Liquidity balance query** to monitor market state

### How It Works:
- If buy side has 80% of liquidity and sell side has 20%:
  - Buy orders: Base APR × 1x (no bonus)
  - Sell orders: Base APR × 2x (maximum bonus)
- Encourages balanced order books for efficient price discovery

### Files Created/Modified:
- `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_balanced.go` - New balanced distribution logic
- `x/dex/keeper/query_liquidity_balance.go` - Query handler
- `x/dex/module/module.go` - Updated to use balanced distribution
- `proto/mychain/dex/v1/query.proto` - Added liquidity balance query
- Documentation files explaining both systems

### Key Benefits:
- **For TUSD holders**: Earn rewards by placing buy orders for MC
- **For MC holders**: Earn rewards by placing sell orders for TUSD
- **Market efficiency**: Balanced liquidity = tighter spreads
- **Dynamic incentives**: Higher rewards where liquidity is needed most

## Todo Status:
- ✅ Analyze current reward system for sell-side implementation
- ✅ Implement sell-side (MC for TUSD) rewards
- ⏳ Test balanced buy/sell reward distribution
- ✅ Update documentation for two-sided rewards

The system now provides comprehensive incentives for both sides of the MC/TUSD market, creating a healthy and efficient trading environment.
