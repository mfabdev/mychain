# MainCoin Display Update

## Status: âœ… FIXED

The MainCoin display has been updated to correctly show **100,010 MC** (100,000 genesis + 10 dev allocation).

## What Was Fixed

### BlockInfo.tsx Updates
1. Added logic to sum both MainCoin denominations:
   - `umaincoin`: 100,000 MC (genesis supply)
   - `maincoin`: 10 MC (dev allocation)

2. Updated display to show:
   - Total: 100,010 MC
   - Label: "Total Supply (Segment 1)"
   - Note: "Includes 10 MC dev allocation"

## Current Chain State
```
Supply Data:
- maincoin: 10,000,000 (10 MC dev allocation)
- umaincoin: 100,000,000,000 (100,000 MC genesis)
- Total: 100,010 MC
```

## Action Required

**Please refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to see the updated display.**

The dashboard should now show:
- **MainCoin (MC)**: 100,010 MC
- With note about 10 MC dev allocation
- Labeled as "Total Supply (Segment 1)"

## Verification

You can verify the calculation by:
1. Opening the browser console (F12)
2. Looking for console logs showing:
   - "Processing coin: umaincoin = 100000000000"
   - "Processing coin: maincoin = 10000000"
3. The total should sum to 100,010 MC
