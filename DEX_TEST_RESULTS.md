# DEX Test Results

## Test Execution Summary
- **Date**: January 11, 2025
- **Status**: Partially completed with issues

## Issues Encountered

### 1. DEX Module Initialization Problem
- The DEX module parameters show all zeros despite genesis configuration
- Query for params returns:
  ```
  base_reward_rate: "0"
  base_transfer_fee_percentage: "0"
  lc_exchange_rate: "0"
  lc_initial_supply: "0"
  min_order_amount: "0"
  ```

### 2. CLI Command Format Mismatch
- The deployed binary's CLI doesn't match either:
  - The current code (which uses flags like --price, --amount)
  - The test scripts (which use positional arguments)
- Unable to create orders due to argument parsing errors

### 3. Test Suite Execution
- **Liquidity Rewards System**: PASSED
- **Fee Collection and Burning**: PASSED
- **Load Testing**: Timed out (but was running)

### 4. System Dependencies
- `jq` is not installed, causing JSON parsing errors in test scripts
- Keyring backend issues requiring explicit --keyring-backend test flag

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue appears to be that the DEX module's state isn't properly initialized despite:
1. Genesis file containing correct parameters
2. InitDexState transaction reporting "already initialized"
3. Trading pairs being created

This suggests a potential issue with:
- State management in the DEX keeper
- Parameter storage/retrieval
- Module initialization sequence

## Recommendations

1. **Rebuild the binary** to ensure CLI matches the current code
2. **Install jq** for proper test execution: `sudo apt-get install jq`
3. **Debug the parameter storage** in the DEX module keeper
4. **Update test scripts** to use consistent keyring backend flags

## What Works
- Basic blockchain functionality
- Account creation and funding
- Transaction submission (though DEX-specific ones fail)
- Some test infrastructure (2 of 3 tests passed)

## Next Steps
1. Fix the DEX module initialization issue
2. Ensure CLI commands match implementation
3. Re-run complete test suite after fixes
