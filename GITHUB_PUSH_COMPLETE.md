## Latest Commit Details

**Commit:** Fix critical reserve calculation bug - ensure 100% of purchase goes to reserves

**Changes:**
- Fixed bug where only 10% of purchase amount was going to reserves instead of 100%
- Updated msg_server_buy_maincoin.go to add full purchase amount to reserves
- Fixed analytical_purchase_with_dev.go reserve calculation
- Verified all purchase methods now correctly add 100% to reserves
- The 10% ratio is only used to determine segment completion thresholds

This fix ensures the MainCoin bonding curve maintains proper 1:10 reserve backing.
