# Transaction Recording Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive transaction recording system that captures all fund movements on the blockchain, including:
- Bank transfers (send/receive)
- MainCoin purchases and sales
- Staking rewards and delegations
- DEX operations
- Fee payments

## Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### Transaction Record Type (`x/mychain/types/transaction_record.go`)
```go
type TransactionRecord struct {
    ID          string
    Address     string
    Type        TransactionType
    Description string
    Amount      sdk.Coins
    From        string
    To          string
    TxHash      string
    Height      int64
    Timestamp   time.Time
    Status      string
    Metadata    string
}
```

#### Transaction Types
- `receive` - Receiving funds
- `send` - Sending funds
- `buy_maincoin` - MainCoin purchases
- `sell_maincoin` - MainCoin sales
- `staking_reward` - Staking rewards
- `delegate` - Delegation transactions
- `undelegate` - Undelegation transactions
- `dex_swap` - DEX swaps
- `fee` - Transaction fees

### 2. Recording Mechanism

#### Event-Based Recording
- Transactions emit `transaction_record` events
- Events are processed in EndBlock to save transaction history
- This approach minimizes gas costs and ensures all transactions are captured

#### Direct Recording in Handlers
- MainCoin buy/sell handlers emit transaction events
- Bank transfer decorator captures send/receive events
- Staking module hooks record delegation events

### 3. Storage

#### Transaction History (`x/mychain/keeper/transaction_history.go`)
- Stored by address for efficient querying
- Indexed by height and type for filtering
- Reverse iteration for newest-first display

### 4. Query API

#### REST Endpoint
```
GET /mychain/mychain/v1/transaction-history/{address}?limit=100
```

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "tx_hash": "ABC123...",
      "type": "buy_maincoin",
      "description": "Bought 279.013985 MainCoin for 1000000 utestusd",
      "amount": [{"denom": "maincoin", "amount": "279013985"}],
      "from": "cosmos1...",
      "to": "maincoin_reserve",
      "height": 96,
      "timestamp": "2025-06-06T06:07:28Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Web Dashboard Integration

### Transaction History Component
- Real-time transaction display
- Type-based filtering
- Color-coded transaction types
- Automatic refresh

### Features
- Icon indicators for transaction types
- Formatted amounts and timestamps
- Address shortening for readability
- Responsive table layout

## Usage Examples

### Viewing Transaction History
```bash
# Query via CLI
mychaind query mychain transaction-history cosmos1abc... --limit 50

# Query via REST API
curl http://localhost:1317/mychain/mychain/v1/transaction-history/cosmos1abc...
```

- üí∞ Sell MainCoin (orange)
- üéÅ Staking Reward (green)
- üîí Delegate (blue)
- üîì Undelegate (orange)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Pagination Support**
   - Add pagination to handle large transaction histories
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for efficiency

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Date range filters
   - Amount range filters
   - Multiple type selection

3. **Export Functionality**
   - CSV export for accounting
   - JSON export for integration

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket support for live updates
   - Push notifications for significant transactions

5. **Analytics**
   - Transaction volume charts
   - Spending/earning trends
   - Portfolio performance metrics
