# Developer Allocation - Final Clarification

## The Correct Understanding

### Dev Allocation = 0.01% on ALL MainCoin

1. **Genesis 100,000 MC** → Dev gets 10 MC
   - This is calculated when moving to segment 1
   - Not visible at genesis, but accrues to dev

2. **Each Segment** → Dev gets 0.01% of segment size
   - Segment 0 (100M MC) → Dev gets 10,000 MC
   - Segment 1 (100M MC) → Dev gets 10,000 MC
   - And so on...

### Timeline Example

| Time | Event | Dev Receives | Dev Total |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Genesis | 100,000 MC created | 0 (pending) | 0 |
| Segment 0 | Someone buys 50M MC | 5,000 MC | 5,000 |
| Segment 0 | Someone buys 50M MC | 5,000 MC | 10,000 |
| Segment 1 starts | Segment change | 10 MC (from genesis) | 10,010 |
| Segment 1 | Someone buys 100M MC | 10,000 MC | 20,010 |

### Key Points

1. **Genesis MC are NOT exempt** - They generate 10 MC dev allocation
2. **Timing** - Genesis dev allocation is credited when segment 1 starts
3. **Consistency** - Every MC contributes 0.01% to dev allocation

### Why This Matters

- Total dev allocation is predictable: 0.01% of total supply
- Genesis MC are treated the same as purchased MC
- Segment 1 will show dev with 10 MC from genesis allocation

### Summary

- Genesis: 100,000 MC → Dev gets 10 MC (at segment 1)
- Segment 0: Up to 100M MC → Dev gets up to 10,000 MC
- Segment 1: Up to 100M MC → Dev gets up to 10,000 MC
- Formula: Dev MC = Total MC × 0.0001
