## DEX Order Matching and Trade History Fixes

### Issues Fixed

1. **Order Overfilling Bug**
   - **Problem**: Orders were being matched multiple times without reloading state, causing filled amounts to exceed order amounts
   - **Example**: Order 18 showed 800 MC filled on a 500 MC order, then 300 MC filled after 200 MC traded
   - **Root Cause**: Double-counting in order_matching_with_fees.go - filled amounts were updated both in ExecuteOrderWithFees AND in MatchOrder
   - **Fix**: 
     - Added order reloading in match_all_crossed_orders.go
     - Removed duplicate filled amount updates in order_matching_with_fees.go
     - Created FixOrder18 function to correct historical data

2. **Trade History Implementation**
   - **Added**: Complete trade recording system
   - **Components**:
     - Trade proto type in types.proto
     - Trades storage with indexing by pair
     - Trade recording in order matching logic
     - Query endpoint for retrieving trades
     - Frontend display of recent trades

3. **UI Fixes**
   - **Fixed**: Hardcoded "Last Price: 0.000100" now shows dynamic trade prices
   - **Fixed**: Order book now shows remaining amounts instead of original amounts
   - **Fixed**: Trade history display with proper buy/sell indicators and timestamps

4. **Gas Limit Issues**
   - **Problem**: Orders failing with "out of gas" errors
   - **Fix**: Increased gas limit from 500,000 to 600,000 in terminal-server.js
   - **Note**: terminal-server.js is gitignored, so this change is not committed

### Order 18 Timeline
- Started with 500 MC
- First trade: 100 MC (but showed 200 MC filled due to bug)
- After first fix: Corrected to show 100 MC filled, 400 MC remaining
- Second trade: 100 MC (but showed 300 MC filled due to continued double-counting)
- After second fix: Corrected to show 200 MC filled, 300 MC remaining

### Technical Details

1. **Double-counting Fix**:
   ```go
   // In order_matching_with_fees.go, removed:
   buyOrder.FilledAmount.Amount = buyOrder.FilledAmount.Amount.Add(matchAmount)
   sellOrder.FilledAmount.Amount = sellOrder.FilledAmount.Amount.Add(matchAmount)
   
   // These updates now happen only in order_matching.go after ExecuteOrderWithFees returns
   ```

2. **Trade Recording**:
   ```go
   trade := types.Trade{
       Id:          tradeID,
       PairId:      order.PairId,
       BuyOrderId:  buyOrder.Id,
       SellOrderId: sellOrder.Id,
       Buyer:       buyOrder.Maker,
       Seller:      sellOrder.Maker,
       Price:       oppositeOrder.Price,
       Amount:      sdk.NewCoin(order.Amount.Denom, matchAmount),
       ExecutedAt:  sdkCtx.BlockTime().Unix(),
   }
   ```

3. **Order Display Fix**:
   ```go
   // In query_order_book.go, filter out overfilled orders:
   remaining := order.Amount.Amount.Sub(order.FilledAmount.Amount)
   if remaining.IsZero() || remaining.IsNegative() {
       return false, nil
   }
   ```

### Current State
- DEX order matching works correctly without double-counting
- Trade history is recorded and queryable
- UI shows accurate order states and trade history
- Gas limits have been adjusted for successful order placement

### Notes
- The trades query endpoint sorts by timestamp descending, so trades with similar timestamps may not appear in ID order
- Order matching happens both immediately (when orders cross) and in EndBlock
- terminal-server.js changes are not committed as the file is gitignored
