# Segment History API Implementation Status

## Summary
The REST endpoints for segment history have been successfully implemented and are accessible. However, the segment history recording feature is currently disabled due to excessive gas consumption.

## Implemented Endpoints

### Working Endpoints:
1. **Segment History All**: `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment-history`
   - Returns empty array currently (no recorded history)
   - Endpoint is properly registered and accessible

2. **Segment Details**: `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment/{segment_number}`
   - Endpoint is registered and accessible
   - Would return segment details if history was recorded

3. **Segment Statistics**: `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment-statistics`
   - Endpoint is registered and accessible
   - Would return aggregated statistics

4. **Segment Info**: `/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment_info`
   - ✅ Working and returns current segment information
   - Example response:
   ```json
   {
     "current_epoch": "26",
     "current_price": "0.000102632761501603",
     "total_supply": "100289040760",
     "reserve_balance": "1028252",
     "tokens_needed": "10153875",
     "reserve_ratio": "0.099898753899963431",
     "dev_allocation_total": "10026775"
   }
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Cosmos SDK)
1. Proto definitions are complete in `/proto/mychain/maincoin/v1/query.proto`
2. Query server implementations are in place:
   - `query_segment_history.go`
   - `query_segment_history_detailed.go`
3. gRPC Gateway is properly generated and registered
4. Module correctly registers the query service

### Segment History Recording
- The `RecordSegmentPurchases` function is implemented but **temporarily disabled**
- Reason: Excessive gas consumption causes transactions to fail
- Located in: `msg_server_buy_maincoin.go` (lines 166-173)

### Web Dashboard
The web dashboard has been updated to handle both scenarios:
1. When blockchain segment history is available (future)
2. When it's not available (current) - displays calculated data

The `useSegmentHistory` hook now:
- Correctly queries the REST endpoints
- Falls back to calculated segment data when blockchain history is unavailable
- Provides accurate segment progression based on the 1:10 reserve ratio algorithm

## Current Status
- ✅ REST endpoints are properly registered and accessible
- ✅ Web dashboard can display segment history (calculated)
- ❌ Actual blockchain segment history recording is disabled (gas issues)
- ✅ Current segment information is available via API

## Next Steps
To enable full segment history from blockchain:
1. Optimize the segment history recording to reduce gas consumption
2. Consider alternative storage approaches (e.g., events-only tracking)
3. Implement pagination properly for large histories
4. Add indexing for efficient queries

## Testing
You can test the endpoints with:
```bash
# Get all segment history (currently empty)
curl http://localhost:1317/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment-history

# Get current segment info (working)
curl http://localhost:1317/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment_info

# Get segment statistics (currently empty)
curl http://localhost:1317/mychain/maincoin/v1/segment-statistics
```
