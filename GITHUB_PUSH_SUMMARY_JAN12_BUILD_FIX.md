## Commit: fix: Resolve GitHub Actions build failure and integrate DEX with MainCoin pricing

### Summary
This push resolves the GitHub Actions release build failure and completes the integration between DEX and MainCoin modules for accurate price tracking.

### Key Changes

1. **DEX System-Wide Tier Calculation**
   - Fixed tier labeling to be system-wide based on market conditions
   - All orders now correctly show the same tier when the system is in that tier
   - Tier is determined by overall market price deviation, not individual order prices

2. **MainCoin Price Integration**
   - DEX now fetches real-time MainCoin prices from the MainCoin module
   - Replaced hardcoded $0.0001 with actual segment price (e.g., $0.000138518971498235)
   - Price updates automatically as segments progress

3. **Build Fixes for CI/CD**
   - Fixed import errors in `scripts/debug_dex_params_storage.go`
   - Added build configuration to `config.yml` to specify main package
   - Created `scripts/build-all.sh` helper for comprehensive builds

### Files Changed
- `config.yml` - Added build.main configuration
- `scripts/debug_dex_params_storage.go` - Fixed imports
- `scripts/build-all.sh` - New build helper script
- `x/dex/keeper/` - Multiple files for price integration
- `x/dex/module/depinject.go` - Added MainCoinKeeper dependency
- `x/dex/types/expected_keepers.go` - MainCoinKeeper interface

### Testing
- ✅ Local release build successful with `ignite chain build --release`
- ✅ All Go modules compile without errors
- ✅ DEX correctly displays system-wide tiers
- ✅ DEX uses actual MainCoin prices

### Impact
- GitHub Actions release workflow should now complete successfully
- DEX pricing is now accurate and reflects actual MainCoin value
- Tier-based rewards distribution works correctly with system-wide tiers

### Next Steps
After pushing:
1. Monitor GitHub Actions to confirm build success
2. Verify release artifacts are created properly
3. Test DEX operations with live MainCoin prices
