# Node Stopped Confirmation

## âœ… The blockchain node has been completely stopped

### Verification:
1. **No mychaind processes running**: `ps aux | grep mychaind` returns nothing
2. **RPC not responding**: http://localhost:26657 is not accessible
3. **Ports are free**: No services listening on blockchain ports

### What was stopped:
- Main blockchain daemon (mychaind)
- RPC endpoint (port 26657)
- REST API (port 1317)
- gRPC endpoint (port 9090)

### Note:
The web dashboard (port 3000) is still running but will show connection errors since the blockchain is offline.

### Next Steps:
To start the node with the corrected MainCoin implementation:

```bash
# 1. Build the new binary
cd /home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain
make build

# 2. Install it
make install

# 3. Start the node
cd scripts
./start_node.sh
```

The node is now completely stopped and ready for a fresh start with the corrected code.
