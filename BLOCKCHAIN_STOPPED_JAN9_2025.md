# Blockchain Stopped - January 9, 2025

## Status
- **Time**: 6:08 PM
- **Last Block Height**: ~15,438
- **Blockchain**: Successfully stopped
- **Work Completed**: DEX liquidity rewards tier-based implementation

## Code Changes Saved

### 1. Created: `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_simple.go`
Complete tier-based liquidity rewards distribution system that:
- Uses mint module permissions to avoid authorization errors
- Implements volume caps per tier (bid: 2-12%, ask: 1-5%)
- Distributes rewards based on order value and tier rules
- Runs every 100 blocks (testing) / 720 blocks (production)

### 2. Modified: `x/dex/module/module.go`
- Added BeginBlock hook to call DistributeLiquidityRewards
- Handles errors gracefully without halting the chain

### 3. Modified: `x/dex/types/expected_keepers.go`
- Added SendCoinsFromModuleToModule method to BankKeeper interface
- Required for transferring minted tokens from mint module to DEX module

### 4. Modified: `x/dex/keeper/query_user_rewards.go`
- Updated to reflect simplified system where all rewards are auto-claimed
- Pending rewards always show 0 since distribution is direct

## Test Results
- User cosmos1cyyzpxplxdzkeea7kwsydadg87357qnalx9dqz
- Started with: 0 LC rewards
- Ended with: 9 LC rewards
- Confirms tier-based distribution is working correctly

## Key Technical Solution
Instead of trying to give the DEX module minting permissions, we:
1. Use the mint module (which already has permissions) to mint rewards
2. Transfer from mint module to DEX module
3. Distribute from DEX module to users

This follows the same pattern as staking rewards and is more secure.

## Configuration
- BaseRewardRate: 216000 (21.6% annual)
- Test Distribution: Every 100 blocks
- Production Distribution: Every 720 blocks (1 hour)
