# Final Fix for Segment Progression

## Problem Summary
1. The system correctly calculates that ~10.99 MC is needed to reach the 1:10 ratio in Segment 1
2. However, when purchasing exactly that amount, segment progression doesn't trigger
3. The issue is that rounding errors prevent exact 10.0000000% ratio
4. We end up at 99.9999% or 100.0001%, missing the exact threshold

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Exact Equality Check
The BeginBlock automatic progression uses `actualReserve.Equal(requiredReserve)` which fails due to rounding.

### Issue 2: Purchase Logic Doesn't Check Post-Purchase Ratio
The purchase logic determines `isSegmentComplete` before the purchase, not after. When we're at 99.9999% and buy tokens, we might overshoot to 100.0001% without triggering segment completion.

### Issue 3: Need to Handle Crossing the Threshold
When we're just below 10% (e.g., 99.9999%), even a tiny purchase can take us past 10%. The system should detect this crossing and mark the segment as complete.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Epsilon Tolerance in BeginBlock
```go
// Instead of exact equality
if actualReserve.Equal(requiredReserve)

// Use epsilon tolerance
reserveDiff := requiredReserve.Sub(actualReserve).Abs()
epsilon := math.LegacyNewDecWithPrec(1, 6) // 0.000001
if reserveDiff.LTE(epsilon)
```

### 2. Post-Purchase Ratio Check
Added a check after updating supply and reserves to see if we've reached the perfect ratio:

```go
// Check if we've reached the perfect ratio (with epsilon tolerance)
if !isSegmentComplete && tokensToBuy.GT(sdkmath.ZeroInt()) {
    newTotalValue := currentSupplyDec.Mul(currentPriceCalc)
    newRequiredReserve := newTotalValue.Mul(reserveRatio)
    reserveDiff := newRequiredReserve.Sub(currentReserveDec).Abs()
    epsilon := sdkmath.LegacyNewDecWithPrec(1, 6) // 0.000001
    
    // If we're within epsilon of the perfect ratio, mark segment as complete
    if reserveDiff.LTE(epsilon) {
        isSegmentComplete = true
        currentSegmentTokens = currentSegmentTokens.Add(tokensToBuy)
    }
}
```

### 3. Detect Threshold Crossing (Still Needed)
When we start below 10% and end up above 10%, we've crossed the threshold and should complete the segment. This requires checking:
- Was the ratio < 10% before purchase?
- Is the ratio >= 10% after purchase?
- If yes to both, mark segment complete

## Test Results
- Starting at Segment 1 with 99.89% ratio
- Correctly calculated need for 10.99 MC
- Purchased 10.989 MC → reached 99.9989%
- Purchased 1.099 MC → reached 99.9999%
- Purchased 0.00999 MC → reached 100.0001%
- Segment progression didn't trigger because we overshot

## Next Steps
Need to implement threshold crossing detection to handle the case where a purchase takes us from below 10% to above 10%.
