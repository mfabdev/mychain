# Session Summary: Volume Cap Fixes

## Date: January 12, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Unit Conversion Issue
- **Problem**: `GetMCSupplyValueInQuote` was mixing whole units with micro units
- **Fix**: Added proper conversion to ensure result is in whole quote units
- **Result**: MC supply value now correctly calculated as $14.77

### 2. Volume Accumulation
- **Problem**: Orders weren't being accumulated properly against caps
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper accumulation logic for buy and sell orders separately
  - Sort orders by competitiveness (best prices first)
  - Track volume cap fractions for partial eligibility

### 3. Logging and Debugging
- **Added extensive logging**:
  - Volume cap calculations
  - Order processing details
  - Cap enforcement decisions
  - Partial capping information

## Current Status

Based on logs, the volume caps are being calculated correctly:
- MC total supply value: $14.77
- Tier 1 bid cap (2%): $0.295
- Tier 1 ask cap (1%): $0.148

However, the logs show:
- Eligible buy value: $0.295 (exactly at cap)
- Eligible sell value: $0.148 (exactly at cap)

This suggests either:
1. The total order values exactly match the caps (unlikely)
2. There's still an issue with cap enforcement

## Remaining Issues

1. **Individual order processing logs not appearing** - The Info level logs for individual orders aren't showing, making it hard to debug the exact cap enforcement
2. **Volume cap fractions still showing as 1.0** - Orders aren't being marked as partially capped
3. **All orders still receiving rewards** - Despite caps being reached

## Next Steps

1. Increase log verbosity or change log levels to see individual order processing
2. Add more detailed logging around the cap check logic
3. Verify the order sorting is working correctly
4. Check if there's a logic error in how caps are being applied

## Files Modified

1. `/x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards.go` - Fixed unit conversion in GetMCSupplyValueInQuote
2. `/x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go` - Added volume accumulation and logging
3. Web dashboard files - Fixed user address for liquidity positions display

## Technical Details

The volume cap enforcement should work as follows:
1. Orders are sorted by price (best first)
2. Each order is checked against remaining cap space
3. If order exceeds cap, it gets partial allocation
4. Orders beyond the cap get no rewards

The logs confirm caps are being calculated but not properly enforced on individual orders.
