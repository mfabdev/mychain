# Session Summary: Order 5 Reward Analysis
Date: January 24, 2025

## Issue Investigated
User reported getting logged out when pasting order 5 information, and questioned why order 5 was receiving 362 ulc instead of expected 550 ulc (11 ulc × 50 transactions).

## Key Findings

### 1. Login Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Page reload after order placement was disconnecting wallet
- **Location**: `web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx:374`
- **Fix**: Replaced `window.location.reload()` with API calls to refresh data without page reload
- **Result**: Wallet stays connected when pasting order information

### 2. Reward Calculation Clarified
Order 5 is receiving the correct rewards:

- **Order 5 Value**: $0.10 (1000 MC at $0.0001)
- **Current APR**: 100% (dynamic rate at maximum due to low liquidity)
- **Hourly Reward**: 11.415525 ulc (rounded to 11 ulc)
- **Order 5 Share**: 29.3% of user's total rewards

### 3. Reward Distribution Explained
- Rewards are distributed **hourly** (every 100 blocks in test mode), not per transaction
- User receives rewards for all orders together: 38 ulc/hour total
- Order 5 gets 11 ulc out of the 38 ulc hourly distribution
- After ~33 hourly distributions: 11 ulc × 33 = 363 ulc ✓

### 4. User's Order Portfolio
```
Order 1: $0.09 value → 10 ulc/hour
Order 2: $0.09 value → 10 ulc/hour  
Order 3: $0.0495 value → 6 ulc/hour
Order 4: $0.011 value → 1 ulc/hour
Order 5: $0.10 value → 11 ulc/hour
Total: 38 ulc/hour
```

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Reward System
- Base rate: 222 (7% APR)
- Current rate: 3175 (100% APR) due to low liquidity
- Rewards use tier-based distribution with volume caps
- Minimal rounding loss: 0.415525 ulc/hour for order 5

### Files Modified
- `web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx` - Fixed page reload issue

## Conclusion
The reward system is working correctly. The confusion arose from misunderstanding that rewards are distributed hourly (not per transaction) and that the "50 payments" shown includes all reward distributions across all orders.
