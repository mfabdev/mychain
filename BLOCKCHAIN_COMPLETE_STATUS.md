# ✅ Blockchain Complete Status

## Current State

The blockchain and web dashboard are now running with the correct configuration:

### Token Distribution
- **Total LC**: 100,000 LC = 100,000,000,000 ulc (100 billion ulc)
  - **Staked**: 90,000 LC = 90,000,000,000 ulc (90%)
  - **Available**: 10,000 LC = 10,000,000,000 ulc (10%)
- **Gas (ALC)**: 100,000 alc
- **TestUSD**: 100,000 utestusd
- **MainCoin**: 10,000,000 umain

### Services Running
- **Blockchain**: ✅ Active at http://localhost:26657
- **API**: ✅ Active at http://localhost:1317
- **Web Dashboard**: ✅ Active at http://localhost:3000

### Key Conversion
- 1 LC = 1,000,000 ulc
- This is why 100,000 LC = 100,000,000,000 ulc

### Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Corrected token amounts (was using 1 billion, now using 100 billion ulc)
2. ✅ Fixed web dashboard to display validators and tokens correctly
3. ✅ Updated denomination checks from 'ALC' to 'ulc' in UI components
4. ✅ Rebuilt and restarted web dashboard with fixes

### Active Features
- 20% annual staking rewards on LC
- Hourly reward distribution (every 720 blocks)
- MainCoin bonding curve
- Transaction recording system
- Full API functionality
- Web dashboard visualization

The system is now running exactly as requested with 100,000 LC total.
