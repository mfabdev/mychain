# Session Summary: DEX Rewards Allocation and UI Display Fix

## Date: January 25, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sell-side Reward Allocation Bug
**Problem**: Orders closest to spread were getting priority instead of orders furthest from spread
- Order 6 ($0.000110) was getting full rewards while Order 7 ($0.000120) was only getting partial rewards
- This was backwards - higher priced sell orders should get priority

**Solution**: Fixed volume cap enforcement logic in `lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go`:
- Changed from `orderValue = orderValue.Mul(cappedFraction)` to `orderValue = remainingCap`
- This ensures exact cap amount is used, preventing subsequent orders from getting rewards when cap is exhausted

### 2. Order Reward Info Not Being Saved
**Problem**: Order 2 wasn't appearing in the API rewards data, causing UI to show incorrect rewards
- Volume cap fractions weren't being persisted during reward distribution
- UI was calculating rewards based on 100% eligibility instead of actual capped amounts

**Solution**: Modified reward distribution to always create/update order reward info:
- Moved order reward info creation outside of the `orderRewards.IsPositive()` check
- Now all orders get their volume_cap_fraction saved, even if they don't earn rewards
- This ensures UI can properly display capped reward amounts

### 3. UI Display Improvements
**Problem**: 
- Price ranges showing confusing "$0.000100 - $0.000100" for orders at same price with different statuses
- No visual indication of mixed eligibility at same price level

**Solution**: 
1. Changed price range display to show order counts by status at each price
2. Added gradient colors to Market Price Range chart for mixed status positions
3. Added purple ring around dots with mixed eligibility
4. Updated legend to include "Mixed Status" with gradient color

## Technical Changes

### Backend (`x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go`)
- Fixed volume cap enforcement to use exact remaining cap amount
- Ensured all orders get reward info created/updated during distribution
- Added logging for debugging reward calculations

### Frontend (`src/components/LiquidityPositions.tsx`)
- Added logic to detect mixed status positions at same price
- Implemented gradient colors for ranges with mixed eligibility
- Changed price range info to show order counts instead of confusing ranges
- Added visual indicators (purple rings) for mixed positions

## Results
- Order 7 (furthest from spread) now correctly gets priority for sell-side rewards
- All orders properly show their volume cap fractions in the API
- UI displays accurate hourly rewards based on actual eligibility percentages
- Visual chart clearly shows mixed status positions with gradient colors
- Price range information is clearer and more informative

## Current Status
- Backend: Fixed and tested, properly allocating rewards by distance from spread
- API: Returns correct volume_cap_fraction for all orders
- UI: Displays accurate rewards and clear visual indicators for mixed positions
- All changes committed to git repository
