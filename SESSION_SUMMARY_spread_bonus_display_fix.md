# Session Summary: Spread Bonus Display Fix

## Date: January 24, 2025

## Problem
User reported that spread bonus information (ðŸŽ¯ 2.0x) was showing in "Your Active Orders" but not in the detailed "Liquidity Positions" view.

## Root Cause
1. **Frontend Inconsistency**: Two different components were calculating spread bonuses differently:
   - "Your Active Orders" (DEXPage): Calculates potential bonus based on current market conditions
   - "Liquidity Positions": Was also calculating potential bonus, not showing actual stored values

2. **Backend Reality**: Order #5 has `spread_multiplier: 0.000000000000000000` because it was placed before the spread bonus system was implemented

## Fix Applied
Updated `LiquidityPositions.tsx` to:
1. Fetch actual spread multipliers from the backend via `/mychain/dex/v1/order_rewards/{address}`
2. Display actual spread bonus when it exists (ðŸŽ¯ icon with yellow background)
3. Display potential spread bonus when order has no bonus (ðŸ“Š icon with gray background)
4. Add tooltip explaining that order was placed before spread bonuses were implemented

## Visual Changes
- **Active spread bonus**: ðŸŽ¯ 2.0x spread bonus (yellow background) - order IS earning bonus
- **Potential spread bonus**: ðŸ“Š Potential 2.0x (gray background) - order COULD earn bonus if placed now
- Added note in rewards section: "(Could earn 200% APR with spread bonus)"

## Technical Details
- Added `potentialMultiplier` and `potentialBonusType` fields to `LiquidityPosition` interface
- Fetches order rewards data to get actual `spread_multiplier` values
- Falls back to calculating potential bonus only when actual multiplier is 1.0

## Result
Users can now distinguish between:
1. Orders that ARE earning spread bonuses (placed after implementation)
2. Orders that COULD earn spread bonuses (placed before implementation)

This provides transparency about why some orders show different bonus information in different views.
