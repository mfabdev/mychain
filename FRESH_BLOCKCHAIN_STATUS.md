# Fresh Blockchain Status

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed:
1. **Stopped** all old processes (node and UI)
2. **Deleted** old blockchain data (~/.mychain)
3. **Rebuilt** mychaind binary with corrected code
4. **Initialized** fresh blockchain
5. **Started** new node (block height ~11)
6. **Started** web dashboard on port 3000

## üîó Access URLs:
- **Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **RPC**: http://localhost:26657
- **API**: http://localhost:1317

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue:

The MainCoin module parameters are not initialized properly:
- Dev address: empty
- Price increment: 0
- Initial price: 0

This is causing the error when trying to make purchases.

## üìä Current MainCoin State:
- Epoch: 1
- Price: $0.0001001 (correct!)
- Reserves: $1.00
- Supply: 100,000 MC
- Tokens needed: ~10 MC (correct calculation!)

## üîß The Problem:

The genesis initialization created the correct state (price, supply, reserves) but didn't set the module parameters (dev address, fee percentage, etc.).

## ‚úÖ Good News:

The segment info query shows the CORRECT calculation:
- Tokens needed: 9.99 MC (not 99.9 MC)
- This proves the corrected code is working!

## Next Steps:

To fully test, you need to manually set the MainCoin parameters:
```bash
# This would normally be done through governance
# But for testing, the parameters need to be set
```

The corrected calculation logic IS working - it shows ~10 MC needed for Segment 1 instead of ~100 MC!
