# Session Summary: DEX Liquidity Rewards Implementation

Date: January 8, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on understanding and implementing the DEX liquidity reward system with correct parameters for 7% annual returns in LC tokens.

## Initial Confusion
- Initially misunderstood the DEX reward system, calculating 315,360% APR
- User clarified that rewards should be 7% annual paid in LC tokens
- LC value: 0.0001 MC = $0.00000001 (with MC at $0.0001)

## Key Requirements Clarified
1. **Buy Side (TUSD → MC)**
   - Volume cap: Higher of 2% MC market cap OR 72-hour volume
   - Orders sorted by price (highest first)
   - 7% annual rewards on locked TUSD

2. **Sell Side (MC → TUSD)**
   - Volume cap: Higher of 1% MC market cap OR 36-hour volume
   - Orders sorted by price (highest first)
   - 7% annual rewards on locked MC value

3. **Additional Parameters**
   - Reference price updates every 3 hours automatically
   - First-come-first-served for orders at same price
   - MC initial price: $0.0001
   - LC = 0.0001 MC

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Base Reward Rate Correction
**File**: `x/dex/types/params.go`
```go
// Changed from:
DefaultBaseRewardRate = "100"  // This gave 3,153,600% APR!

// To:
DefaultBaseRewardRate = "0.222"  // For 7% annual returns
```

### 2. Automatic Price Updates
**File**: `x/dex/keeper/price_updates.go` (NEW)
- `UpdateReferencePrices()`: Updates all pair prices every 3 hours
- `CalculateMarketPrice()`: Uses order book mid-point
- `GetBestBidPrice()` and `GetBestAskPrice()`: Find best prices

**File**: `x/dex/module/module.go`
- Added price update check in `BeginBlock()`

### 3. Volume Window Corrections
**File**: `x/dex/types/genesis.go`
Updated all tier windows from hours to match specification:
- Tier 1: 48 hours (172800s)
- Tier 2: 72 hours (259200s) - User's original requirement
- Tier 3: 96 hours (345600s)
- Tier 4: 120 hours (432000s)

### 4. Testing
**File**: `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_test.go` (NEW)
- Verifies 7% annual return calculation
- Tests tier activation based on price drops
- Validates volume cap enforcement

## Calculation Verification

For $1,000 TUSD order:
```
Base Rate: 0.222
Order Value: 1,000,000,000 utusd
Time: 1 year (31,536,000 seconds)

LC Earned = (1,000,000,000 × 0.222 × 31,536,000) / 1,000,000
         = 7,000,992,000 LC
         = $70.01 (at $0.00000001 per LC)
         = 7.001% annual return ✓
```

## Tier System Summary

The DEX uses a dynamic tier system that responds to market conditions:

| Tier | Activation | Buy Cap | Sell Cap | Window | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| 1    | 0% drop    | 2%      | 1%       | 48h     | Normal market |
| 2    | -3% drop   | 5%      | 3%       | 72h     | Minor support |
| 3    | -8% drop   | 8%      | 4%       | 96h     | Major support |
| 4    | -12% drop  | 12%     | 5%       | 120h    | Crisis support |

## Documentation Created

1. **DEX_LIQUIDITY_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md** - Original user requirements
2. **DEX_BASE_RATE_CALCULATION.md** - Initial calculation (wrong)
3. **DEX_BASE_RATE_CALCULATION_FINAL.md** - Correct calculation
4. **DEX_UPWARD_PRICE_PRESSURE_PROPOSAL.md** - Price pressure analysis
5. **DEX_LIQUIDITY_REWARDS_ACTUAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Current system analysis
6. **DEX_REWARD_SYSTEM_COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md** - Full specification
7. **DEX_IMPLEMENTATION_FINAL.md** - Final implementation guide

## Key Insights

1. **Upward Price Pressure**: The original design (highest prices first) correctly creates upward pressure by incentivizing:
   - Buyers to bid higher
   - Sellers to ask higher
   - Both sides push price up

2. **Dynamic Support**: The tier system automatically provides more liquidity during market stress, creating natural price floors

3. **Sustainable Rewards**: 7% annual returns are attractive but sustainable, unlike the original 3M% rate

## Build Status
✅ Successfully built and installed with all changes

## Git Commits
