# Session Summary: Spread Incentives Implementation

## Date: January 12, 2025 (Evening)

## Overview
Implemented directional spread incentives for the DEX to create natural upward price pressure for MC while improving market efficiency.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Directional Spread Incentives
Unlike traditional spread incentives that just reward tighter spreads, this implementation has different goals for buyers vs sellers:

#### For MC Buyers
- **Goal**: Tighten the bid-ask spread
- **Mechanism**: Higher rewards for placing buy orders closer to the ask price
- **Multipliers**: Up to 2x for 75%+ spread reduction

#### For MC Sellers  
- **Goal**: Push prices higher
- **Mechanism**: Higher rewards for placing sell orders ABOVE current best ask
- **Multipliers**: Up to 1.5x for pricing 10%+ above best ask

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### Files Created
1. **x/dex/keeper/spread_incentives.go**
   - Core calculation logic
   - Separate functions for buy/sell incentives
   - Support for MC/TUSD and LC/MC pairs

2. **x/dex/keeper/query_estimate_order_rewards.go**
   - Query to preview rewards before placing order
   - Shows spread impact and multiplier
   - Helps users optimize their orders

3. **SPREAD_INCENTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
   - Complete documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Market evolution explanation

#### Files Modified
1. **x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards.go**
   - Calculate spread multiplier during order initialization
   - Apply multiplier to reward calculations

2. **x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go**
   - Use weighted liquidity for distribution
   - Account for different multipliers per order

3. **proto/mychain/dex/v1/types.proto**
   - Added spread_multiplier field to OrderRewardInfo

4. **x/dex/keeper/msg_server_create_order.go**
   - Emit spread incentive info in events

### 3. Market Dynamics Created

The system creates a fascinating dynamic:

**Initial State**: Wide spreads, low prices
```
Buy: $0.080    Sell: $0.100 (25% spread)
```

**With Incentives Active**:
- Buyers race to bid $0.085, $0.090, $0.095 (tightening spread)
- Sellers race to ask $0.105, $0.110, $0.120 (pushing price up)

**Result**: Tighter spread at higher price level
```
Buy: $0.095    Sell: $0.102 (7% spread, 10% price increase)
```

### 4. User Experience

#### Query Before Placing
```bash
mychaind query dex estimate-order-rewards \
  --pair-id 1 --amount 1000000000 \
  --price 99000000 --is-buy

# Shows:
# current_spread: "10%"
# new_spread: "1%" 
# spread_improvement: "90% reduction"
# spread_multiplier: "2.0"
# effective_apy: "14%" (7% base × 2.0)
```

#### Order Creation Feedback
Events now include:
- `spread_multiplier`: The bonus earned
- `spread_impact`: Description of market impact

## Key Insights

1. **Aligned Incentives**: Both buyers and sellers work to increase MC value
2. **Natural Price Discovery**: No artificial manipulation, just market dynamics
3. **Efficiency Improvement**: Spreads naturally tighten over time
4. **Sustainable Growth**: Rewards decrease as markets mature

## Testing Notes

The system is ready for testing. Key scenarios to verify:
1. Buy orders that significantly tighten spread get higher rewards
2. Sell orders above market get bonuses
3. Multipliers apply correctly in reward distribution
4. Query accurately predicts rewards
