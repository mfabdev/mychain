# Session Summary - January 9, 2025
## DEX Liquidity Rewards Implementation

### Starting Context
- User had placed DEX offers but rewards were showing as "0.000000 LC"
- Complex per-order reward tracking system was implemented but not working
- User asked: "Why can't we use mint module which already has permission to mint tokens for DEX?"

### Key Achievement
Successfully implemented a simplified tier-based liquidity rewards distribution system that:
1. Uses the mint module's existing permissions (avoiding module permission errors)
2. Properly implements tier-based rewards with volume caps
3. Distributes rewards automatically every 100 blocks (for testing)
4. Increased user rewards from 0 to 9 LC

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Created Simplified Rewards System
- File: `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_simple.go`
- Inspired by staking rewards implementation
- Uses mint module to mint, then transfers to DEX for distribution

#### 2. Key Features
- **Tier-based calculation**: Orders categorized by price deviation
- **Volume caps**: Separate caps for buy (2-12%) and sell (1-5%) orders
- **Order prioritization**: Sorted by price (highest first)
- **Direct distribution**: No claiming needed, rewards sent directly

#### 3. Fixed Issues
- Module permission error: "module account dex does not have permissions to mint tokens"
- Added SendCoinsFromModuleToModule to BankKeeper interface
- Removed unused variables in reward calculation

### Results
- User rewards query shows:
  ```
  claimed_lc:
    amount: "9"
    denom: liquiditycoin
  pending_lc:
    amount: "0"
    denom: liquiditycoin
  ```
- System successfully distributing rewards according to tier rules

### Files Modified
1. Created: `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_simple.go`
2. Modified: `x/dex/module/module.go` (BeginBlock)
3. Modified: `x/dex/types/expected_keepers.go` (BankKeeper interface)
4. Modified: `x/dex/keeper/query_user_rewards.go`

### Documentation Created
- `DEX_LIQUIDITY_REWARDS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation details
- This session summary file

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. Change BlocksPerHour from 100 back to 720 for production
2. Implement proper market price oracle
3. Add rolling volume tracking for accurate enforcement

### Key Insight
Using existing module permissions (mint module) is simpler and more secure than trying to add new permissions to the DEX module. This approach follows the same pattern as staking rewards.
