# DEX Genesis Debug Summary

## Issue
The DEX module's genesis state is not being loaded during chain initialization, despite:
- Correct genesis JSON with proper types
- Module properly registered in app config
- InitGenesis function implemented correctly

## Evidence
1. **Genesis file has correct DEX config** with trading pairs, tiers, and parameters
2. **DEX module is running** - endpoints respond but return empty state
3. **Parameters show as zeros** - indicating InitGenesis wasn't called
4. **No errors in logs** - suggesting silent failure or skipped initialization

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes:
1. **Module initialization order** - DEX might need dependencies not yet available
2. **Genesis validation failing silently** - Some field might not parse correctly
3. **Store key mismatch** - Module might be using wrong store key
4. **Depinject issue** - Module might not be wired correctly

### What We've Tried:
1. ✅ Fixed JSON types (strings to numbers)
2. ✅ Set correct base_reward_rate (0.222)
3. ✅ Cleaned data and restarted multiple times
4. ✅ Verified genesis file structure
5. ❌ Genesis still not loading

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Continue Without DEX
The blockchain works fine for:
- MainCoin operations
- Staking 
- TestUSD
- All other features

### Option 2: Manual State Initialization
Could implement a governance proposal or admin transaction to:
- Create trading pairs
- Set parameters
- Initialize tiers

### Option 3: Debug Module Loading
Would need to:
- Add extensive logging to module.go
- Trace the InitGenesis call path
- Check depinject wiring

## Current Status
- Blockchain is functional
- DEX module responds but has no data
- Web dashboard correctly calls DEX endpoints
- Trading pairs don't exist in state

## Impact
- Cannot place DEX orders
- Cannot earn liquidity rewards
- Order book shows "trading pair not found"
- But all other blockchain features work normally
