# Corrected Segment Logic for MainCoin - Final Version

## Overview of Corrected Logic

The segment logic has been corrected so that:
1. **Segments complete when the 1:10 ratio is restored** after a price increase
2. **Price increases 0.1% each time a segment completes**
3. **Dev allocation (0.01%) applies when segments complete**

## How Segments Work

### The Key Mechanism

1. **Price Increase Creates Deficit**: When price increases 0.1%, the total value increases, creating a small reserve deficit
2. **Next Purchase Restores Ratio**: The next purchase that restores the 1:10 ratio completes a segment
3. **Small Amounts Needed**: In early stages, only ~10 MC needed per segment

### Example: Segment 1

Starting after Genesis:
- Supply: 100,000 MC
- Price: $0.0001001 (increased from $0.0001)
- Reserves: $1.00

The 0.1% price increase creates:
- Total Value: 100,000 × $0.0001001 = $10.01
- Required Reserves: $10.01 × 0.1 = $1.001
- Deficit: $0.001

To complete Segment 1:
- Purchase: $0.001 ÷ 0.1 = $0.01
- Tokens: $0.01 ÷ $0.0001001 = 9.99 MC
- With dev: 9.991 MC total (0.001 to dev)

## Correct Numbers for First 5 Segments

| Segment | Deficit | Purchase | Tokens | User | Dev | New Supply |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|------|-----|------------|
| 1 | $0.001 | $0.01 | 9.991 | 9.990 | 0.001 | 100,009.991 |
| 2 | $0.0011 | $0.011 | 10.979 | 10.978 | 0.001 | 100,020.970 |
| 3 | $0.00121 | $0.0121 | 12.065 | 12.064 | 0.001 | 100,033.034 |
| 4 | $0.00133 | $0.0133 | 13.247 | 13.246 | 0.001 | 100,046.281 |
| 5 | $0.00146 | $0.0146 | 14.537 | 14.536 | 0.001 | 100,060.818 |

## Key Differences from Old Understanding

### Old (Incorrect) Understanding
- Thought segments needed ~100 MC each
- Calculated large amounts per segment
- Misunderstood the reserve dynamics

### New (Correct) Understanding
- Segments need only 10-15 MC in early stages
- Each segment restores the small deficit from price increase
- Creates many small segments instead of few large ones

## Benefits of Corrected Logic

1. **Granular Price Discovery**: Price adjusts frequently in small increments
2. **Low Barrier to Entry**: Even $0.01 can complete a segment
3. **Smooth Progression**: No large jumps between segments
4. **Fair Distribution**: Small buyers can participate meaningfully

## Example: $10 Purchase

### With Old Logic
- Would complete 1 segment
- Buy ~99,900 MC
- Price increases 0.1%

### With Correct Logic  
- Completes ~500-1000 segments
- Buys ~5,000-10,000 MC
- Price increases 50-100%

## Implementation Details

The corrected logic is implemented in:
- `analytical_purchase_with_dev.go`: Core calculation
- `msg_server_buy_maincoin.go`: Transaction handling
- Tests verify the correct behavior

## Testing the Logic

```go
// A $0.01 purchase should complete Segment 1
result := CalculatePurchase($0.01, segment1State)
assert(result.SegmentsCompleted == 1)
assert(result.TokensBought ≈ 10 MC)
```

## Conclusion

The corrected implementation creates an elegant system where:
- Each 0.1% price increase creates a small deficit
- Restoring the 1:10 ratio completes a segment
- Early segments need only ~10 MC
- Natural exponential growth emerges over time
