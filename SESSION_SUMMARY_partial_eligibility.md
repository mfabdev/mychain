# Session Summary: Partial Eligibility Implementation for DEX Volume Caps

## Date: June 24, 2025

## Overview
Implemented partial eligibility support for DEX orders that exceed volume caps, allowing orders to receive proportional rewards based on how much of their volume fits within the cap.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Proto Changes (`proto/mychain/dex/v1/types.proto`)
- Added `volume_cap_fraction` field to `OrderRewardInfo` message:
  ```proto
  string volume_cap_fraction = 9 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "cosmossdk.io/math.LegacyDec",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
  ```

#### Reward Distribution (`x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go`)
- Modified volume cap checking to track partial eligibility
- Added `cappedFraction` calculation for orders that partially exceed caps
- Updated order processing to apply volume cap fraction to rewards
- Store `VolumeCapFraction` in OrderRewardInfo during distribution

#### Reward Calculation (`x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards.go`)
- Updated `CalculateOrderLCRewards` to apply volume cap fraction multiplier
- Modified `InitializeOrderRewards` to set initial VolumeCapFraction to 1.0

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### LiquidityPositions Component
- Added support for displaying partial eligibility status
- Created visual indicators for eligible/partial/ineligible orders
- Added `RewardEligibilityChart` component for visual representation
- Updated eligibility logic to check `volume_cap_fraction` from backend

### 3. Key Features

#### Volume Cap Enforcement
- Orders that fit entirely within cap: 100% eligible (volume_cap_fraction = 1.0)
- Orders that partially exceed cap: Partially eligible (0 < volume_cap_fraction < 1.0)
- Orders that completely exceed cap: Ineligible (volume_cap_fraction = 0)

#### Visual Feedback
- Progress bar showing portfolio eligibility breakdown
- Color-coded status pills (green/yellow/red)
- Percentage display for partial eligibility
- Effective APR calculation based on eligibility

## Technical Details

### Volume Cap Calculation
```go
// For partially exceeding orders
remainingCap := volumeCap.Sub(currentVolume)
cappedFraction = remainingCap.Quo(orderValue)
eligibleValue = orderValue.Mul(cappedFraction)
```

### Reward Application
```go
// Apply volume cap fraction to rewards
volumeCapFraction := orderRewardInfo.VolumeCapFraction
rewardsDec := baseRewardsDec.Mul(spreadMultiplier).Mul(volumeCapFraction)
```

## Testing
Created test orders to demonstrate:
- Fully eligible orders (within volume cap)
- Partially eligible orders (partially exceed cap)
- Ineligible orders (fully exceed cap)

## Files Modified

2. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_dynamic_tier.go`
3. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards.go`
4. `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/web-dashboard/src/components/LiquidityPositions.tsx`

## Next Steps
- Monitor rewards distribution to verify partial eligibility is working correctly
- Consider adding ability to adjust order size to fit within cap
- Add more detailed logging for volume cap calculations
