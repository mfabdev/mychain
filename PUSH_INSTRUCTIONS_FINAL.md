# Push Instructions - Dynamic DEX Rewards Implementation

## Changes Ready to Push

Your changes have been committed and are ready to push. The commit includes:

### Commit: `63a92f29` - feat: Implement dynamic DEX reward system (7-100% APR)

**What it does:**
- Incentivizes TUSD holders to place buy orders for MC on the DEX
- Dynamic rewards (7-100% APR) paid in LC tokens for maintaining liquidity
- Rates adjust based on market conditions and liquidity needs
- Creates buying pressure and liquidity support for MainCoin

## To Push to GitHub

Since authentication is required, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain
git push origin main
```

You'll be prompted for your GitHub credentials or personal access token.

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI
If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```bash
gh auth login
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH
If you have SSH keys set up:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mfabdev/mychain.git
git push origin main
```

## What Happens After Push

1. The dynamic reward system will be available in the codebase
2. When blockchain is launched, TUSD buy orders for MC will earn LC rewards
3. Rates start at 100% APR to attract initial liquidity
4. System automatically adjusts every 6 hours based on liquidity depth

## Verification

After pushing, others can test by:
1. Launching blockchain: `./scripts/unified-launch.sh --reset`
2. Placing TUSD buy orders for MC on the DEX
3. Waiting 100 blocks to see LC rewards distributed
4. Monitoring dynamic rate adjustments

The system is designed to maintain healthy liquidity for MC trading!
