# Dev Allocation Per Segment Fix - Complete

## Summary
Successfully fixed the dev allocation system to calculate and distribute dev tokens for EACH segment, not just once per transaction.

## Problem
The previous implementation only calculated dev allocation once at the end of all segments, resulting in dev receiving only ~10 MC when processing 25 segments, instead of receiving allocations for each segment.

## Solution
Modified the dev allocation logic to:
1. Calculate dev allocation at the end of EACH segment based on ALL tokens in that segment
2. Accumulate pending dev throughout the transaction
3. Distribute accumulated dev at the start of subsequent segments

## Key Code Changes

### 1. Fixed Dev Calculation to Include All Tokens
```go
// Calculate dev allocation for THIS completed segment
// CRITICAL: Include both purchased tokens AND dev distributed at start of segment
totalSegmentTokens := currentSegmentTokens
if segmentsProcessed == 0 && pendingDevAllocation.GT(sdkmath.ZeroInt()) {
    // First segment: add the pending dev that was distributed
    totalSegmentTokens = totalSegmentTokens.Add(pendingDevAllocation)
} else if segmentsProcessed > 0 && devDistributedInSegment.GT(sdkmath.ZeroInt()) {
    // Subsequent segments: add the dev that was distributed at start
    totalSegmentTokens = totalSegmentTokens.Add(devDistributedInSegment)
}

if totalSegmentTokens.GT(sdkmath.ZeroInt()) {
    // Calculate 0.01% of ALL tokens in this segment
    devDec := sdkmath.LegacyNewDecFromInt(totalSegmentTokens).Mul(devAllocationRate)
    segmentDevAllocation := devDec.TruncateInt()
    accumulatedPendingDev = accumulatedPendingDev.Add(segmentDevAllocation)
}
```

### 2. Fixed Nil Pointer Issue
```go
// Initialize pendingDevForNext properly
pendingDevForNext := sdkmath.ZeroInt()
```

## Test Results

### Transaction Details
- **Input**: $1.00 purchase request
- **Actual Spent**: $0.028252 (28,252 utestusd)
- **Segments Completed**: 25
- **Total Tokens Bought**: 279,040,760 uMC (~279.04 MC)
- **User Tokens**: 279,013,985 uMC (~279.01 MC)
- **Dev Tokens Distributed**: 26,775 uMC (~0.026775 MC)
- **Pending Dev for Next**: 1,113 uMC

### Dev Account Balance
- Initial: 10,000,000 uMC (from segment 0â†’1)
- Added: 26,775 uMC (from 25 segments)
- Total: 10,026,775 uMC

### Per-Segment Behavior
Each segment correctly:
1. Distributes accumulated dev at the start (if any)
2. Buys tokens to reach 1:10 ratio
3. Calculates 0.01% dev allocation on ALL tokens in segment
4. Accumulates dev for next segment

## Impact
This fix ensures fair and correct dev allocation across all segments, maintaining the intended economic model where dev receives 0.01% of all tokens minted in each segment.
