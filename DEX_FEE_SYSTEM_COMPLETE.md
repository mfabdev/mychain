# DEX Fee System Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive fee system for the DEX with dynamic pricing based on market conditions and liquidity availability.

## Fee Structure

### Base Fees
- **Transfer Fee**: 0.01% base (min 0.0001 LC)
- **Maker Fee**: 0.01% flat rate (min 0.0001 LC)
- **Taker Fee**: 0.05% base (min 0.005 LC)
- **Cancel Fee**: 0.01% flat rate (min 0.0001 LC)
- **Sell Fee**: 0.01% base (min 0.0001 LC)

### Dynamic Fee Adjustments
1. **Price-Based Dynamic Fees**
   - Triggered when price drops below 98% threshold
   - Additional 0.01% fee per 10 basis points below threshold
   - NO CAPS - designed to discourage trading during volatility

2. **Liquidity-Based Multipliers**
   - 0-1% impact: 1x multiplier (no change)
   - 1-5% impact: 1x to 2x multiplier
   - 5-10% impact: 2x to 5x multiplier
   - 10-25% impact: 5x to 10x multiplier
   - 25-50% impact: 10x to 25x multiplier
   - 50%+ impact: 25x to 50x multiplier (capped)

## Implementation Details

### Core Files
1. **Fee Calculation**: `x/dex/keeper/dynamic_fees.go`
   - `CalculateDynamicFees()` - calculates all fee rates
   - `CalculateTransferFee()` - transfer fee with minimums
   - `CalculateMakerFee()` - flat maker fee
   - `CalculateTakerFee()` - dynamic taker fee
   - `CalculateCancelFee()` - flat cancel fee
   - `CalculateSellFee()` - dynamic sell fee
   - `CollectFee()` - collects fees to module account
   - `BurnCollectedFees()` - burns all collected fees

2. **Liquidity Impact**: `x/dex/keeper/liquidity_impact.go`
   - `GetLiquidityImpactMultiplier()` - calculates fee multiplier
   - `ApplyLiquidityImpactToFees()` - applies multiplier to fees
   - `GetAvailableLiquidity()` - calculates available liquidity

3. **Order Matching**: `x/dex/keeper/order_matching_with_fees.go`
   - Integrated fee collection into order execution
   - Proper maker/taker identification

4. **Fee Parameters**: Updated in `x/dex/types/params.proto`
   - All fee percentages and minimums
   - `fees_enabled` flag (default: true)

### Query Endpoints
1. **EstimateFees**: Calculate fees before placing order
   ```bash
   mychaind query dex estimate-fees [pair-id] [is-buy] [amount] [price]
   ```

2. **FeeStatistics**: View fee collection statistics
   ```bash
   mychaind query dex fee-statistics
   ```

## Fee Collection Flow
1. User places order → fees calculated based on:
   - Order type (maker/taker)
   - Current market conditions
   - Available liquidity
2. Fees collected to DEX module account
3. At end of each block, all fees are burned (100% burn rate)
4. Creates deflationary pressure on LC token

## Configuration
Fees are enabled by default in new blockchains. To modify:
```bash
# Disable fees
mychaind tx dex update-dex-params --fees-enabled=false --from admin

# Adjust base rates (example: 0.02% maker fee)
mychaind tx dex update-dex-params --base-maker-fee=0.0002 --from admin
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Check current fee parameters
mychaind query dex params

# Estimate fees for a $10,000 buy order at $0.0001
mychaind query dex estimate-fees 1 true 100000000000 100

# View fee statistics
mychaind query dex fee-statistics

# Place order with fees
mychaind tx dex create-order buy 1 10000000000 100 --from user1
```
