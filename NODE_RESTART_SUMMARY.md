# Node Restart Summary

## ✅ Node Successfully Rebuilt and Restarted

### What Was Done:
1. **Stopped** the old node completely
2. **Fixed** compilation errors in the code
3. **Built** new binary with corrected MainCoin logic
4. **Installed** the new binary to $HOME/go/bin/
5. **Started** the node with the new binary

### Current Status:
- Node is running at block height ~774
- Current epoch: 59
- Current price: $0.000106074 per MC
- RPC: http://localhost:26657
- API: http://localhost:1317
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000

### ⚠️ Issue Detected:

The test purchase shows the system is **still using the old calculation logic**:
- Purchased with: $0.01
- Received: 94.27 MC

With the corrected logic, $0.01 should only buy ~10-15 MC, not 94 MC.

### Possible Reasons:

1. **State Issue**: The blockchain state already has the old logic embedded
2. **Module Registration**: The new implementation might not be properly registered
3. **Binary Issue**: The system might be using a different binary path

### Next Steps:

To fully implement the corrected logic, you may need to:
1. Start a fresh blockchain (reset the state)
2. Or create a governance proposal to update the module
3. Or verify which message server implementation is being used

The code has been correctly updated and compiled, but the running blockchain is still executing the old logic.
