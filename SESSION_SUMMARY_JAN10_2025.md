# Session Summary - January 10, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing DEX liquidity rewards not updating when additional orders were placed, implementing order cancellation functionality, and ensuring the terminal server starts automatically during blockchain initialization.

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. DEX Liquidity Rewards Not Updating
**Problem**: When users added additional orders, their liquidity rewards didn't increase.
**Root Cause**: Genesis file used incorrect field names (`volume_cap_mc` instead of `bid_volume_cap`) preventing reward calculation.
**Solution**: Created Python script to fix genesis field names and ensure proper reward distribution.

### 2. Order Cancellation Bug
**Problem**: Order cancellation failed with "insufficient funds" error.
**Root Cause**: Refund calculation multiplied micro units incorrectly (tried to refund 1 billion TUSD instead of 1,000 TUSD).
**Solution**: Fixed calculation in `msg_server_cancel_order.go` by dividing by 10^6 after multiplication.

### 3. Terminal Server Not Starting Automatically
**Problem**: Terminal server needed to be manually started for web dashboard transactions.
**Solution**: Added automatic terminal server startup to `unified-launch.sh` script.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. DEX Module Updates
- Fixed volume cap field names in genesis configuration
- Corrected order cancellation refund calculation
- Enhanced reward distribution logic

### 2. Web Dashboard Improvements
- Implemented complete order cancellation UI with individual cancel buttons
- Added "Your Active Orders" section showing all user orders
- Enhanced transaction history with better filtering and error handling
- Fixed transaction display issues (showing raw JSON instead of parsed data)

### 3. Infrastructure Updates
- Added automatic terminal server startup in `unified-launch.sh`
- Terminal server now starts before DEX initialization
- Enhanced cleanup process to stop all related services

### 4. Scripts Created
- `scripts/fix_dex_volume_caps.py` - Fixes genesis volume cap field names
- `scripts/debug_transaction_history.sh` - Debug transaction storage
- `scripts/test-dex-init.sh` - Test DEX initialization
- `monitor_rewards.sh` - Monitor DEX rewards in real-time

## Files Modified

### Core Module Files
- `x/dex/keeper/msg_server_cancel_order.go` - Fixed refund calculation
- `x/dex/keeper/lc_rewards_simple.go` - Enhanced reward distribution
- `x/mychain/keeper/transaction_history.go` - Improved transaction storage
- `x/mychain/keeper/transaction_recorder.go` - Fixed key generation

### Web Dashboard Files
- `web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx` - Complete redesign with order management
- `web-dashboard/src/components/TransactionHistory.tsx` - Fixed JSON parsing
- `web-dashboard/src/App.tsx` - Added personal dashboard route
- `web-dashboard/src/utils/formatters.ts` - Enhanced formatters

### Script Files
- `scripts/unified-launch.sh` - Added terminal server auto-start
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start fresh blockchain with terminal server
./scripts/unified-launch.sh --reset

# Verify terminal server is running
lsof -i:3003

# Check DEX rewards
mychaind query dex user-rewards cosmos1sqlsc5024sszglyh7pswk5hfpc5xtl77xrgn5a

# View transaction history
mychaind query mychain transaction-history cosmos1sqlsc5024sszglyh7pswk5hfpc5xtl77xrgn5a
```

## Current State
- Blockchain running with proper DEX initialization
- Terminal server running on port 3003
- Web dashboard deployed with full order management
- All DEX functionality working correctly

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider implementing real-time order updates via WebSocket
2. Add order matching visualization
3. Implement historical trade data tracking
