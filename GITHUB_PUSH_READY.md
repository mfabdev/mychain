## To Push to GitHub

Since you're using HTTPS authentication, you have several options:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Then push with:
git push https://<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/mfabdev/mychain.git main
```

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# If you have GitHub CLI installed:
gh auth login
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Credential Manager
```bash
# This will prompt for username/password:
git push origin main
# Enter your GitHub username and personal access token as password
```
