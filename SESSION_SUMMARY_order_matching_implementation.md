# Session Summary: Order Matching Implementation

## Date: January 26, 2025

## Issue
The DEX module had crossed order books where buy orders at higher prices weren't matching with sell orders at lower prices. For example:
- Buy orders at $0.000108 and $0.000105
- Sell order at $0.000105
These should have matched but weren't executing trades.

## Root Cause
The `MatchOrder` function in `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/x/dex/keeper/order_matching.go` was just a stub returning `nil`. Order matching was not implemented.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Implemented Complete Order Matching Logic
Modified `order_matching.go` to:
- Find opposite orders (buy vs sell) for the same trading pair
- Match orders when buy price >= sell price
- Sort matches by best price (lowest sell first, highest buy first)
- Execute trades using existing `ExecuteOrderWithFees` function
- Update filled amounts for both orders
- Save updated orders to state
- Emit trade events

### 2. Key Features
- Price-time priority matching
- Matches execute at maker's price
- Partial fills supported
- Proper fund transfers with fee handling
- Event emission for trade tracking

### 3. Testing Results
Successfully tested with new orders:
- Buy order at 109 matched with sell order at 105
- Trade executed at maker's price (105)
- Filled amounts updated correctly
- Orders with remaining amounts stay in order book

## Current Status
- Order matching is fully functional for new orders
- Existing crossed orders from before the implementation remain unmatched
- The system now prevents future crossed order books

## Technical Details
The matching algorithm:
1. When a new order is created, `MatchOrder` is called
2. Scans all opposite orders on same trading pair
3. Matches if buy price >= sell price
4. Executes trades at maker (existing order) price
5. Updates filled amounts and saves to state
6. Continues matching until order is filled or no matches remain

## Files Modified
- `/home/dk/go/src/myrollapps/mychain/x/dex/keeper/order_matching.go` - Implemented full matching logic

## Next Steps
The existing crossed orders need to be handled either by:
1. Running a one-time matching process for existing orders
2. Canceling and recreating the crossed orders
3. Waiting for them to be manually canceled or matched against new orders
