# Session Summary: Rewards Display Fix

## Date: January 24, 2025

## Problem
User reported seeing "Total Earned: 0.000000 LC" and "Last Reward: Never" despite Order #5 being placed 2 days ago.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Rewards ARE Being Paid
- Blockchain logs confirm: User receiving 38 ulc/hour (total for all orders)
- Order #5 contributes 11 ulc/hour of that total
- 50 reward payments made totaling 430 ulc
- Recent payments are correctly 38 ulc each

### 2. Display Issues Fixed

#### Problem 1: Rewards Too Small to Display
- 38 ulc = 0.000038 LC
- Was showing as "0.000000 LC" due to 6 decimal precision
- **Fix**: Now shows exact ulc amounts in parentheses when < 0.001 LC

#### Problem 2: Individual Order Attribution
- DEX distributes rewards as lump sum to user, not per order
- Transaction metadata doesn't contain order IDs
- **Fix**: Calculate each order's proportional share based on hourly rate

#### Problem 3: Last Reward Time
- Was looking for order-specific reward transactions (which don't exist)
- **Fix**: Show most recent reward distribution to user

## UI Improvements

1. **Hourly Rewards**:
   - Shows "11.4 ulc/hr" in yellow when amount is small
   - More decimal places in USD value

2. **Total Earned**:
   - Shows actual total from all payments (430 ulc)
   - Displays "430 ulc total" in yellow for clarity

3. **Last Reward**:
   - Now correctly shows timestamp of last distribution

## Technical Details

The confusion arose because:
1. Rewards are paid in very small amounts (38 ulc = $0.0000038)
2. Frontend was showing "0.000000" due to rounding
3. User couldn't see that rewards WERE being paid

Now the UI clearly shows:
- Exact ulc amounts when LC amount rounds to 0
- Actual payment history
- Proportional attribution to each order
