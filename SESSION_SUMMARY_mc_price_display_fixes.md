# Session Summary: MC Price Display Fixes

## Date: January 12, 2025

## Issues Fixed

1. **Incorrect MC Price Display**
   - Problem: Multiple components were showing hardcoded $0.0001 instead of actual MC price
   - Root cause: API returns `price` field but components were looking for `current_price`
   - Fixed in:
     - DynamicRewardsInfo.tsx
     - DEXPage.tsx
     - SpreadIncentivesInfo.tsx
     - LCPriceDisplay.tsx

2. **LC Price USD Value Rounding**
   - Problem: LC price showing $0.00000001 instead of $0.0000000142
   - Root cause: `toFixed(8)` was rounding the very small number
   - Solution: Changed to `toFixed(11)` for more precision

3. **Confusing LC Price Display**
   - Problem: Display showed "0.000100 MC" and "$0.00000001420 USD" without clear context
   - Solution: Redesigned display to clearly show:
     - "1 LC equals: 0.000100 MC"
     - Separated USD value with clear label
     - Added current MC price reference

## Technical Changes

### API Field Name Fixes
Changed from looking for `current_price` to `price` in:
- `/mychain/maincoin/v1/current_price` API responses

### Price Display Improvements
- Fixed unnecessary division by 1,000,000 in SpreadIncentivesInfo and LCPriceDisplay
- Added logging to help debug price calculations
- Improved decimal precision for very small USD values

### UI/UX Improvements
- Clearer labeling: "LC Reference Price" instead of just "Reference Price"
- Added explanatory text: "1 LC equals:" before showing MC amount
- Separated MC-to-LC rate from USD value with visual borders
- Added current MC price display for reference

## Files Modified
1. `web-dashboard/src/components/DynamicRewardsInfo.tsx`
2. `web-dashboard/src/pages/DEXPage.tsx`
3. `web-dashboard/src/components/SpreadIncentivesInfo.tsx`
4. `web-dashboard/src/components/LCPriceDisplay.tsx`
5. `web-dashboard/src/components/LiquidityPositions.tsx` (partial eligibility work from earlier)
6. `web-dashboard/public/index.html` (cache control headers)

## Result
All price displays now show correct values:
- MC price: $0.000142 (from blockchain)
- LC price: 0.0001 MC = $0.0000000142 USD
- Clear, understandable UI that explains what each number represents
